The Good Earth,['Pearl S. Buck'],Open Road Media,2012-08-21,"The Pulitzer Prize–winning, New York Times–bestselling novel about a peasant farmer and his family in early twentieth-century China. The Good Earth is Buck’s classic story of Wang Lung, a Chinese peasant farmer, and his wife, O-lan, a former slave. With luck and hard work, the couple’s fortunes improve over the years: They have sons, and save steadily until one day they can afford to buy property in the House of Wang—the very house in which O-lan used to work. But success brings with it a new set of problems. Wang soon finds himself the target of jealousy, and as good harvests come and go, so does the social order. Will Wang’s family cherish the estate after he’s gone? And can his material success, the bedrock of his life, guarantee anything about his soul? Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the William Dean Howells Award, The Good Earth was an Oprah’s Book Club choice in 2004. A readers’ favorite for generations, this powerful and beautifully written fable resonates with universal themes of hope and family unity. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Pearl S.

A History of Malaysia,"['Barbara Watson Andaya', 'Leonard Y. Andaya']",University of Hawaii Press,2001-01-01,"Malaysia's multicultural society supports one of the most dynamic economies in Asia. This completely revised new edition of the standard text, first published twenty years ago, traces the history of the country from early times to the present day. The authors give particular attention to the evolution of Malay polities and their close links with indigenous groups who lived on the oceans and in the deep jungles of the region, from Sumatra to Borneo. This provides the background to the establishment of the Malay port of Melaka, which was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511, foreshadowing the establishment of a British colonial regime in the late nineteenth century. Although the large numbers of Chinese and Indian migrants who arrived to work in the tin and rubber industries contributed to economic expansion, colonial policies did not encourage communal interaction. The authors trace the process by which post-independence leaders in Malaya attempted to counter the legacy of ethnic hostility while answering Malay demands for an affirmation of their rights and a stronger commitment to Islam. The incorporation of the Borneo states of Sarawak and Sabah into the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 rendered the goal of welding a nation from areas that were geographically separated and culturally disparate even more problematic. The intense emotions attached to issues of race were made tragically evident in the racial riots of May 1969, which this book sees as a watershed in modern Malaysian history. As Malaysia enters the twenty-first century, the government is determined to oversee the transition to an economy focused on manufacturing and advanced technology, and to eliminate poverty and the association between occupation and race. While several recent studies deal with the impact of colonial rule and Malaysia's spectacular economic transition, this book is unique because it tracks developments from early times and identifies continuities as well as change. Combining the authors' specialist knowledge of precolonial sources with the most recent contemporary research, this new edition reinforces the position of A History of Malaysia position as a standard reference for all those interested in the historical processes which led to the emergence of this culturally varied and economically energetic country.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0824824253'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780824824259'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",418.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,2.2.4.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OTDzzWjmEAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OTDzzWjmEAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OTDzzWjmEAwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MALAYSIA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OTDzzWjmEAwC&dq=intitle:MALAYSIA&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Malaysia.html?hl=&id=OTDzzWjmEAwC,,,,,

I stood by her side as she inspired many others who were also fighting this beast they call cancer, to keep on fighting. We kept the hope strong as she had an army behind her cheering her on, every step of the way. When my mom passed away only ten months after diagnosis I found treasures that she had left behind that told a story of a mother's undying love. Treasures that will forever remain in my mind, body, heart, and soul. Treasures that brought a new hope and a profound reason to carry on the life she loved to live so very much. This true story was written with the intent to inspire many. To those who are fighting the fight, keep on fighting. To those who have experienced tremendous loss, we must remember that even through the darkest of days, life does in fact go on.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1499719949'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781499719949'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",0.0,BOOK,['Lungs'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kILjrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kILjrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=kILjrQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:AND+LIFE+GOES+ON&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=kILjrQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:AND+LIFE+GOES+ON&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Life_Goes_On.html?hl=&id=kILjrQEACAAJ,,,,,
Paris 1919,['Margaret MacMillan'],Hachette UK,2011-11-10,"Previously published as Peacemakers Between January and July 1919, after the war to end all wars, men and women from all over the world converged on Paris for the Peace Conference. At its heart were the leaders of the three great powers - Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau. Kings, prime ministers and foreign ministers with their crowds of advisers rubbed shoulders with journalists and lobbyists for a hundred causes - from Armenian independence to women's rights. Everyone had business in Paris that year - T.E. Lawrence, Queen Marie of Romania, Maynard Keynes, Ho Chi Minh. There had never been anything like it before, and there never has been since. For six extraordinary months the city was effectively the centre of world government as the peacemakers wound up bankrupt empires and created new countries. They pushed Russia to the sidelines, alienated China and dismissed the Arabs, struggled with the problems of Kosovo, of the Kurds, and of a homeland for the Jews. The peacemakers, so it has been said, failed dismally; failed above all to prevent another war. Margaret MacMillan argues that they have unfairly been made scapegoats for the mistakes of those who came later. They tried to be evenhanded, but their goals - to make defeated countries pay without destroying them, to satisfy impossible nationalist dreams, to prevent the spread of Bolshevism and to establish a world order based on democracy and reason - could not be achieved by diplomacy. Paris 1919 (originally published as Peacemakers) offers a prismatic view of the moment when much of the modern world was first sketched out.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781848546684'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1848546688'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",900.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VSx37W6OtOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VSx37W6OtOUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VSx37W6OtOUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:1919&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VSx37W6OtOUC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VSx37W6OtOUC,5.0,1.0,Six Months that Changed the World,,

You Only Fall in Love Three Times,['Kate Rose'],Penguin,2020-01-14,"Discover the three types of love--and the key to finding the one you're truly meant to be with. We love and we love again -- sometimes our hearts get broken but, somehow, we find the courage to dive back in. In this soul-searching book, relationship expert Kate Rose guides readers down the path to a deeper understanding of who they are, what they want, and finally, to the discovery of their Twin Flame. According to Rose, love is a journey of self-discovery and every relationship we have in our lives teaches us something that we need to learn about ourselves and what will make us truly happy. She introduces readers to the three types of love we will all experience: The Soulmate introduces us to the dream of love, but somehow what seemed like it would be ""happily ever after"" wasn't meant to last forever. We are so consumed with making The Karmic Love work that we often fail to question whether it should work. As painful as it is to accept, this love that felt so right in the beginning is actually all wrong. The Twin Flame comes into our lives and often we don't even know it's love because . . . it's too easy. This is the love who helps us to accept ourselves just as we are because this is precisely what they do. In You Only Fall in Love Three Times, Kate Rose shows us that happy endings may not happen quite the way they do in fairytales-- but they happen nonetheless.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525542735'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525542736'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",240.0,BOOK,['Family & Relationships'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HyKbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HyKbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HyKbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THREE+LOVES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HyKbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HyKbDwAAQBAJ,,,The Secret Search for Our Twin Flame,,

A Modern Hero,['Julian Delphiki'],Julian Delphiki,2022-08-04,"""A Modern Hero: Rethinking the Role of Heroism through Films and Video Games"" is a thought-provoking book that delves into the concept of heroism in the contemporary media landscape, particularly focusing on the influence of films and video games. This summary highlights the key themes explored in the book and discusses notable examples from popular culture, such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" film series and the ""Metal Gear Solid"" video game franchise. In this engaging work, the author challenges traditional notions of heroism and examines how modern media platforms have reshaped our understanding of heroic figures. The book argues that films and video games offer a fertile ground for reimagining heroism, presenting a more nuanced and complex portrayal of hero characters. Drawing upon the epic fantasy world of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, the book analyzes the character of Frodo Baggins, who exemplifies a different kind of hero. Rather than relying solely on physical strength and bravery, Frodo embodies moral courage, resilience, and the ability to withstand immense challenges. By exploring Frodo's journey and the conflicts he faces, the author emphasizes the importance of internal struggles, personal growth, and sacrifice as essential components of heroism. Similarly, the book examines the acclaimed video game series ""Metal Gear Solid,"" known for its intricate narratives and multifaceted characters. The protagonist, Solid Snake, represents a departure from traditional hero archetypes. He is burdened with moral ambiguity and confronted with complex choices that blur the line between right and wrong. The book explores how video games, as an interactive medium, allow players to experience the complexities of heroism firsthand, as they navigate moral dilemmas and grapple with the consequences of their actions. Throughout ""A Modern Hero,"" the author challenges readers to reconsider their preconceived notions of heroism and to recognize the evolving nature of the concept in contemporary media. By analyzing films like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and video games like ""Metal Gear Solid,"" the book demonstrates how these narratives prompt us to explore deeper layers of heroism beyond traditional tropes, inviting us to reflect on the complexities of morality, personal growth, and the power of human resilience. ""A Modern Hero: Rethinking the Role of Heroism through Films and Video Games"" provides an insightful exploration of how films and video games have redefined our understanding of heroism. By analyzing examples from popular culture, such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" films and the ""Metal Gear Solid"" games, the book encourages readers to contemplate the multifaceted nature of hero characters and to embrace a more nuanced and inclusive perspective on heroism in the modern age.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9798843854874'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",140.0,BOOK,['Art'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oL_rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oL_rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oL_rEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+MODERN+HERO&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oL_rEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oL_rEAAAQBAJ,,,Rethinking the role of heroism through films and video games,,
The Black Swan,['Nassim Nicholas Taleb'],Random House,2007-04-17,"A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives. Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the impossible. For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don't know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications. The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.The Black Swan is a landmark book, itself a black swan.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UVA:X030103687'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",406.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mcgtAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mcgtAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mcgtAAAAYAAJ&q=intitle:THE+BLACK+SWAN&dq=intitle:THE+BLACK+SWAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mcgtAAAAYAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+BLACK+SWAN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Black_Swan.html?hl=&id=mcgtAAAAYAAJ,4.0,25.0,The Impact of the Highly Improbable,,

Two Jewish sisters from Vienna—12-year-old Stephie Steiner and 8-year-old Nellie—are sent to Sweden to escape the Nazis. They expect to stay there six months, until their parents can flee to Amsterdam; then all four will go to America. But as the world war intensifies, the girls remain, each with her own host family, on a rugged island off the western coast of Sweden. Nellie quickly settles in to her new surroundings. She’s happy with her foster family and soon favors the Swedish language over her native German. Not so for Stephie, who finds it hard to adapt; she feels stranded at the end of the world, with a foster mother who’s as cold and unforgiving as the island itself. Her main worry, though, is her parents—and whether she will ever see them again.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780375893704'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0375893709'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",258.0,BOOK,['Juvenile Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.6.4.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ujanOE9pQrEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ujanOE9pQrEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ujanOE9pQrEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FARAWAY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ujanOE9pQrEC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ujanOE9pQrEC,,,,,

The Fortress,['S. A. Jones'],Erewhon Books,2020-03-17,"“Jones’s radical, detailed vision of what extremes it might take to unlearn misogyny is rendered with insight, immediacy, and painful honesty. This gut-punch of a story is sure to start conversations.” — Publishers Weekly, starred review A searing examination of the dark heart of masculinity confronted by a women-led society. The Handmaid’s Tale meets Herland at a party thrown by Anaïs Nin. Jonathon Bridge has a corner office in a top-tier software firm, tailored suits, and an impeccable pedigree. He has a fascinating wife, Adalia; a child on the way; and a string of pretty young interns as lovers on the side. He’s a man who’s going places. His world is our world: the same chaos and sprawl, haves and have-nots, men and women, skyscrapers and billboards. But it also exists alongside a vast, self-sustaining city-state called The Fortress where the indigenous inhabitants—the Vaik, a society run and populated exclusively by women—live in isolation. When Adalia discovers his indiscretions and the ugly sexual violence pervading his firm, she agrees to continue their fractured marriage only on the condition that Jonathan voluntarily offers himself to The Fortress as a supplicant and stay there for a year. Jonathon’s arrival at The Fortress begins with a recitation of the conditions of his stay: He is forbidden to ask questions, to raise his hand in anger, and to refuse sex. Jonathon is utterly unprepared for what will happen to him over the course of the year—not only to his body, but to his mind and his heart. This absorbing, confronting, and moving novel asks questions about consent, power, love, and fulfillment. It asks what it takes for a man to change, and whether change is possible without a radical reversal of the conditions that seem normal.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781645660040'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1645660044'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",289.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.14.11.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lX-qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lX-qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lX-qDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+FORTRESS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lX-qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lX-qDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Mutiny on the Bounty - Complete Trilogy,"['Charles Nordhoff', 'James Norman Hall']",Good Press,2023-12-24,"The Bounty Trilogy is a book comprising three novels by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall. It relates events prior to, during and subsequent to the Mutiny on the Bounty. ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" is novel based on the mutiny against Lieutenant William Bligh, commanding officer of the HMS Bounty in 1789. It tells the story through a fictional first-person narrator by the name of Roger Byam, based on a crew member Peter Heywood. HMS Bounty was on a voyage to Tahiti for breadfruit plants and some of the crew members were complaining about Lieutenant William Bligh's harsh treatment. The mutiny broke out under the leadership of Fletcher Christian, master's mate on the ship. Mutineers set Bligh afloat in a small boat with members of the crew loyal to him. Byam, although not one of the mutineers, remained with the Bounty after the mutiny. Mutineers continued to sail on the Bounty, looking for a place build a colony, conflicting with natives. ""Men Against the Sea"" follows the journey of Lieutenant William Bligh and the eighteen men set adrift in an open boat by the mutineers of the Bounty. The story is told from the perspective of Thomas Ledward, the Bounty's acting surgeon, who went into the ship's launch with Bligh. It begins after the main events described in the novel and then moves into a flashback, finishing at the starting point. ""Pitcairn's Island"" – After two unsuccessful attempts to settle on the island of Tubuai, the Bounty mutineers returned to Tahiti where they parted company. Fletcher Christian and eight of his men, together with eighteen Polynesians, sailed from Tahiti in September 1789, and for a period of eighteen years nothing was heard of them. Then, in 1808, the American sailing vessel Topaz discovered a thriving community of mixed blood on Pitcairn Island under the rule of Alexander Smith.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'EAN:8596547788362'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",912.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_zzmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_zzmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_zzmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MUTINY+ON+THE+BOUNTY,+Charles+Nordhoff+and+James+N.+Hall.+(Little,+Brown.)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_zzmEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_zzmEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Last Adam,['L. Emerson Ferrell'],"Voice of the Light Ministries, Incorporated",2014-08-28,"All spirits come from God. That means we all knew this majestic plan beginning with Adam and ending where we began - inside God through Christ Jesus, as the last Adam. This one scripture is the very heart of the book... ""And so it is said, the first man Adam was a living soul. The last Adam is a life-giving spirit."" [1 Corinthians 15:45 BBE] Get ready because the veil that has hidden your true nature and identity is about to be ripped off of you forever! And the gospel preached by the last Adam is the power for your transformation. This isn't a how-to book to improve your current status. It's the key that will unlock what you already knew before the foundation of the world! Do you want to reclaim what Adam lost? Do you want to have a creative voice with a frequency of faith that causes the material world to respond? You can have what Adam lost and discover... -The hidden mystery of sin -How the author of sin became its greatest victim -The truth about the power and authority Adam lost This is the first book in a series of short exposés designed to reveal the ever ascending power of the living Christ. Man was created in the image of the One who created all things. The last Adam was not only resurrected over death, but He also defeated the fear of it. If you've ever been afraid it's because you haven't been told the truth about your true identity. Today, when you hear His voice, take that first step into overcoming fear forever. That's what the last Adam gave us. Now, the choice is yours - but you need to take it!","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1933163747'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781933163741'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",112.0,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=twHhoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=twHhoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=twHhoQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LAST+ADAM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=twHhoQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LAST+ADAM&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Last_Adam.html?hl=&id=twHhoQEACAAJ,,,"Ever Ascending Resurrection Series, Vol 1",,

Here She Is,['Hilary Levey Friedman'],Beacon Press,2020-08-25,"A fresh exploration of American feminist history told through the lens of the beauty pageant world. Many predicted that pageants would disappear by the 21st century. Yet they are thriving. America’s most enduring contest, Miss America, celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2020. Why do they persist? In Here She Is, Hilary Levey Friedman reveals the surprising ways pageants have been an empowering feminist tradition. She traces the role of pageants in many of the feminist movement’s signature achievements, including bringing women into the public sphere, helping them become leaders in business and politics, providing increased educational opportunities, and giving them a voice in the age of #MeToo. Using her unique perspective as a NOW state president, daughter to Miss America 1970, sometimes pageant judge, and scholar, Friedman explores how pageants became so deeply embedded in American life from their origins as a P.T. Barnum spectacle at the birth of the suffrage movement, through Miss Universe’s bathing beauties to the talent- and achievement-based competitions of today. She looks at how pageantry has morphed into culture everywhere from The Bachelor and RuPaul’s Drag Race to cheer and specialized contests like those for children, Indigenous women, and contestants with disabilities. Friedman also acknowledges the damaging and unrealistic expectations pageants place on women in society and discusses the controversies, including Miss America’s ableist and racist history, Trump’s ownership of the Miss Universe Organization, and the death of child pageant-winner JonBenét Ramsey. Presenting a more complex narrative than what’s been previously portrayed, Here She Is shows that as American women continue to evolve, so too will beauty pageants.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780807083284'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0807083283'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",290.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4XzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F4XzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=F4XzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:PAGEANT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=F4XzDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:PAGEANT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Here_She_Is.html?hl=&id=F4XzDwAAQBAJ,,,The Complicated Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America,,

The Werewolf of Paris,['Guy Endore'],Simon and Schuster,2021-11-15,"Endore's classic werewolf novel - now back in paperback for the first time in over forty years - helped define a genre and set a new standard in horror fiction The werewolf is one of the great iconic figures of horror in folklore, legend, film, and literature. And connoisseurs of horror fiction know that The Werewolf of Paris is a cornerstone work, a masterpiece of the genre that deservedly ranks with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Endore's classic novel has not only withstood the test of time since it was first published in 1933, but it boldly used and portrayed elements of sexual compulsion in ways that had never been seen before, at least not in horror literature. In this gripping work of historical fiction, Endore's werewolf, an outcast named Bertrand Caillet, travels across pre-Revolutionary France seeking to calm the beast within. Stunning in its sexual frankness and eerie, fog-enshrouded visions, this novel was decidedly influential for the generations of horror and science fiction authors who came afterward.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781639361281'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1639361286'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",241.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+WEREWOLF+OF+PARIS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zrVGEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

It is also a rationalization so that you can be consoled: ’If life is miserable today there is nothing to be worried about, tomorrow everything is going to be well.

Pink Floyd All the Songs,"['Jean-Michel Guesdon', 'Philippe Margotin']",Hachette UK,2017-10-24,"The newest addition to the best-selling All the Songs series details the unique recording history of Pink Floyd, one of the world's most commercially successful and influential rock bands. Since 1965, Pink Floyd been recording sonically experimental and philosophical music, selling more than 250 million records worldwide, including two of the best-selling albums of all time Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. While much is known about this iconic group, few books provide a comprehensive history of their time in the studio. In Pink Floyd All the Songs, authors Margotin and Guesdon describe the origin of their nearly 200 released songs, details from the recording studio, what instruments were used, and behind-the-scenes stories of the tensions that helped drive the band. Organized chronologically by album, this massive, 544-page hardcover begins with their 1967 debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the only one recorded under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership; through the loss of Barrett and the addition of David Gilmour; to Richard Wright leaving the band in 1979 but returning; to Roger Waters leaving in 1985 and the albums recorded since his departure, including their 2014 farewell album, The Endless River, which was downloaded 12 million times on Spotify the week it was released. Packed with more than 500 photos, All the Songs is also filled with stories fans treasure, such as Waters working with engineer Alan Parsons to employ revolutionary recording techniques for The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios in 1972 or producer Bob's Ezrin's contribution in refining Water's original sprawling vision for The Wall.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780316439237'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0316439231'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",592.0,BOOK,['Music'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CRcUDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CRcUDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CRcUDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+ALBUM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CRcUDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CRcUDgAAQBAJ,,,The Story Behind Every Track,,

THE BOOKSELLER De slimme, ambitieuze, naar het volwassen leven verlangende Vanessa Wye is vijftien als ze voor het eerst seks heeft met Jacob Strane, haar charmante en geraffineerde 42-jarige leraar Engels. De allesverterende affaire die volgt isoleert haar van haar omgeving en zal haar nooit meer volledig loslaten. Zeventien jaar later wordt Strane door een andere voormalige leerlinge beschuldigd van seksueel misbruik. Vanessa is diep geschokt door het nieuws, want haar relatie met Strane, dat was toch ware liefde? Wanneer de oud-leerlinge contact met Vanessa opneemt komt zij voor een onmogelijke keuze te staan. Houdt ze vast aan het geloof in haar tienerherinneringen of herdefinieert zij het grootste liefdesverhaal van haar leven en haar seksuele ontwaken? Op superieure wijze beschrijft Kate Elizabeth Russell de psychologische dynamiek van een van de moeilijkste kwesties van onze tijd. Zowel genuanceerd als ongemakkelijk, gedurfd, krachtig en even fascinerend als verontrustend - Mijn duistere Vanessa gaat door merg en been.

Encountering the Past within the Present,['Siobhan Kattago'],Routledge,2019-11-27,"Encountering the Past within the Present: Modern Experiences of Time examines different encounters with the past from within the present – whether as commemoration, nostalgia, silence, ghostly haunting or combinations thereof. Taking its cue from Hannah Arendt’s definition of the present as a time span lying between past and future, the author reflects on the old philosophical question of how to live the good life – not only with others who are physically with us but also with those whose presence is ghostly and liminal. While tradition may no longer command the same authority as it did in antiquity or the middle ages, individuals are by no means severed from the past. Rather, nostalgic longing for bygone times and traumatic preoccupation with painful historical events demonstrate the vitality of the past within the present. Divided into three parts, chapters examine ways in which the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust and communism have been remembered after 1945 and 1989. Maintaining a sustained reflection on the nexus of memory, modernity and time in tandem with ancient questions of responsibility for one another and the world, the volume contributes to the growing field of memory studies from a philosophical perspective. As such, it will appeal to scholars of sociology, social theory and philosophy with interests in collective memory and heritage.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780429656125'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0429656122'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",237.0,BOOK,['Philosophy'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZXzADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZXzADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZXzADwAAQBAJ&pg=PT145&dq=intitle:WITHIN+THIS+PRESENT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZXzADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZXzADwAAQBAJ,,,Modern Experiences of Time,,

""It has a wonderful freshness about it.... A wonderfully large and vital picture."" ―The New York Times Cean and Lonzo are a young couple beginning their married lives two decades before the Civil War in a land where nature is hostile, the seasons dictate the law, and the days are punctuated by the hard work of the land. The couple's only wealth is their hands, their obstinacy, and their love. By the time Cean is forty-three, she has borne fourteen children; buried five of them and her husband; and survived a civil war, venomous snakebite, ferocious panther attack, and a deadly house fire. Neither life nor the din of history has spared her.

"I, Claudius",['Robert Graves'],Rosetta Books,2014-03-06,"“One of the really remarkable books of our day”—the story of the Roman emperor on which the award-winning BBC TV series was based (The New York Times). Once a rather bookish young man with a limp and a stammer, a man who spent most of his time trying to stay away from the danger and risk of the line of ascension, Claudius seemed an unlikely candidate for emperor. Yet, on the death of Caligula, Claudius finds himself next in line for the throne, and must stay alive as well as keep control. Drawing on the histories of Plutarch, Suetonius, and Tacitus, noted historian and classicist Robert Graves tells the story of the much-maligned Emperor Claudius with both skill and compassion. Weaving important themes throughout about the nature of freedom and safety possible in a monarchy, Graves’s Claudius is both more effective and more tragic than history typically remembers him. A bestselling novel and one of Graves’ most successful, I, Claudius has been adapted to television, film, theatre, and audio. “[A] legendary tale of Claudius . . .

Van Dine was born Willard Huntington Wright in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1888. He attended St. Vincent College, Pomona College and Harvard University, but failed to graduate, leaving to cultivate contacts he had made in the literary world. At the age of twenty-one, Wright began his professional writing career as literary editor of the Los Angeles Times. In 1926, Wright published his first S. S. Van Dine novel, The Benson Murder Case. Wright went on to write eleven more mysteries. The first few books about his upper-class amateur sleuth, Philo Vance, were so popular that Wright became wealthy for the first time in his life. His later books declined in popularity as the reading public's tastes in mystery fiction changed, but during the late twenties and early thirties his work was very successful.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781473379787'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1473379784'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",272.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_MBmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_MBmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_MBmCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+CASINO+MURDER+CASE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_MBmCwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+CASINO+MURDER+CASE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Casino_Murder_Case_A_Philo_Vance_Det.html?hl=&id=_MBmCwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Lost Horizon,['James Hilton'],DigiCat,2022-11-13,"Shangri-La is a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, and particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia – a permanently happy land, isolated from the outside world. In the novel, Hugh Conway, a veteran member of the British diplomatic service, finds inner peace, love, and a sense of purpose in Shangri-La, whose inhabitants enjoy unheard-of longevity. Among the book's themes is an allusion to the possibility of another cataclysmic world war brewing.

The Forty Days of Musa Dagh,['Franz Werfel'],David R. Godine Publisher,2012,"The Forty Days of Musa Dagh is Franz Werfel's masterpiece that brought him international acclaim in 1933, drawing the world's attention to the Armenian genocide. This is the story of how the people of several Armenian villages in the mountains along the coast of present-day Turkey and Syria chose not to obey the deportation order of the Turkish government. Instead, they fortified a plateau on the slopes of Musa Dagh""€""Mount Moses""€""and repelled Turkish soldiers and military police during the summer of 1915 while holding out hope for the warships of the Allies to save them. The original English translation by Geoffrey Dunlop has been revised and expanded by translator James Reidel and scholar Violet Lutz. The Dunlop translation, had excised approximately 25% of the original two-volume text to accommodate the Book-of-the-Month club and to streamline the novel for film adaptation. The restoration of these passages and their new translation gives a fuller picture of the extensive inner lives of the characters, especially the hero Gabriel Bagradian, his wife Juliette, their son Stephan""€""and Iskuhi Tomasian, the damaged, nineteen-year-old Armenian woman whom the older Bagradian loves. What is more apparent now is the personal story that Werfel tells, informed by events and people in his own life, a device he often used in his other novels as well, in which the author, his wife Alma, his stepdaughter Manon Gropius, and others in his circle are reinvented. Reidel has also revised the existing translation to free Werfel's stronger usages from Dunlop's softening of meaning, his effective censoring of the novel in order to fit the mores and commercial contingencies of the mid-1930s. In bringing The Forty Days of Musa Dagh back into print and revising the English translation, we aim to make this new Verba Mundi edition more faithful to the book Thomas Mann read ""with pleasure and profit"" in German.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781567924077'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1567924077'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",938.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3ZUwsyv2ngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G3ZUwsyv2ngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3ZUwsyv2ngC&dq=intitle:THE+FORTY+DAYS+OF+MUSA+DAGH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=G3ZUwsyv2ngC&dq=intitle:THE+FORTY+DAYS+OF+MUSA+DAGH&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Forty_Days_of_Musa_Dagh.html?hl=&id=G3ZUwsyv2ngC,,,,,

Barney Glasgow, who had fought his way up from chore-boy in the lumber camps of Iron Ridge to lumber king of Wisconsin, is fifty-three and has much reason to be content when the granddaughter of his old friend, Swan Bostrom, disrupts his life. But destiny provides an ironic escape from folly, and Barney's son carries on the story—a story which was to end in those fatal months that closed the year 1929. Rich with the vibrant qualities of life itself, this is more than the story of Barney Glasgow and his children. It is the story of lumber, and the story of the making and breaking of a fortune, during one of the most fascinating periods in the history of Wisconsin, and of the nation.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345806154'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345806158'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gWA-xfTu0HkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gWA-xfTu0HkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gWA-xfTu0HkC&pg=PT145&dq=intitle:COME+AND+GET+IT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gWA-xfTu0HkC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gWA-xfTu0HkC,,,,,

Time Out of Mind,['Ian Bell'],Random House,2013-09-12,"By the middle of the 1970s, Bob Dylan’s position as the pre-eminent artist of his generation was assured. The 1975 album Blood on the Tracks seemed to prove, finally, that an uncertain age had found its poet. Perverse or driven, Dylan refused the role. By the decade’s end, the counter-culture’s poster child had embraced conservative, evangelical Christianity. Fans and critics alike were confused; many were aghast. Still the hits kept coming. Then Dylan faltered. His instincts, formerly unerring, deserted him. In the 1980s, what had once appeared unthinkable came to pass: the ‘voice of a generation’ began to sound irrelevant, a tale told to grandchildren. Yet in the autumn of 1997 something remarkable happened. Having failed to release a single new song in seven long years, Dylan put out the equivalent of two albums in a single package. He called it Time Out of Mind. So began the renaissance, artistic and personal, that culminated in 2012’s acclaimed Tempest. In the concluding volume of his groundbreaking study, Ian Bell explores the unparalleled second act in a quintessentially American career. It is a tale of redemption, of an act of creative will against the odds, and of a writer who refused to fade away. Time Out of Mind is the story of the latest, perhaps the last, of the many Bob Dylans. This one might yet turn out to have been the most important of them all.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781780578354'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1780578350'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",576.0,BOOK,['Music'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bbx8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bbx8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bbx8AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TIME+OUT+OF+MIND&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bbx8AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bbx8AAAAQBAJ,,,The Lives of Bob Dylan,,

Published when Josephine Johnson was only twenty-four years old, Now in November made Johnson the youngest ever winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1935. It is a beautifully told account of one farming family’s challenges to scrape by and earn a living from mortgaged land over the course of a single year, narrated by one of three sisters—the introspective and thoughtful Margaret. As the household is ravaged by Depression-era hardship and the environmental blights of the Dust Bowl, the family’s unique vulnerabilities are pushed to a breaking point. In a style typical of Johnson’s body of work, Now in November is strikingly ahead of its time, grappling with questions of mental health, worker’s rights, as well as gender, race, and class and is ready to be rediscovered by a new generation of readers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781668004227'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1668004224'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",304.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U2x2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U2x2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=U2x2EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NOW+IN+NOVEMBER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=U2x2EAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:NOW+IN+NOVEMBER&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Now_in_November.html?hl=&id=U2x2EAAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Lucy Gayheart,['Willa Cather'],Vintage,2011-08-24,"In this haunting 1935 novel, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of My Ántonia performs crystalline variations on the themes that preoccupy her greatest fiction: the impermanence of innocence, the opposition between prairie and city, provincial American values and world culture, and the grandeur, elation, and heartache that await a gifted young woman who leaves her small Nebraska town to pursue a life in art. At the age of eighteen, Lucy Gayheart heads for Chicago to study music. She is beautiful and impressionable and ardent, and these qualities attract the attention of Clement Sebastian, an aging but charismatic singer who exercises all the tragic, sinister fascination of a man who has renounced life only to turn back to seize it one last time. Out of their doomed love affair—and Lucy's fatal estrangement from her origins—Willa Cather creates a novel that is as achingly lovely as a Schubert sonata.

Je zult maar met iedereen ruzie hebben,['Caroline de Gruyter'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2022-06-21,"Europa is de afgelopen jaren drastisch veranderd omdat de wereld is veranderd. Dit boek, een selectie van columns in NRC Handelsblad van januari 2017 tot aan de eerste weken van de oorlog in Oekraïne in maart 2022, brengt die verandering in beeld. Aan de hand van actuele gebeurtenissen, puttend uit de historie en de literatuur, schrijft Caroline de Gruyter helder en gepassioneerd over het voortmodderende Europa. Voor sommigen is Europa te machtig, voor anderen is het te slap en verdeeld. De Gruyter kijkt anders. Geboeid volgt zij hoe de wereld verandert, en hoe Europa constant meeverandert. Dankzij haar diepgaande analyses leren we Europa stap voor stap beter kennen. Wellicht ontluikt er soms zelfs wat liefde voor de oude dame.

The Stars Look Down,['AJ Cronin'],Rosetta Books,2015-04-15,"This thought-provoking novel of the challenges a coal mining community faces in the early twentieth century is “the finest work Cronin has given his public” (Kirkus Reviews). First published in 1935, The Stars Look Down tells the story of a North Country mining town as its inhabitants make their way through social and political upheaval. Digging into workers’ rights, social change, and the relationship between labor and capitalism, the struggles of the novel’s trifecta of protagonists—politically minded miner David Fenwick, ambitious drifter Joe Gowlan, and frustrated yet meek mining-baron’s son Arthur Barras—remain compelling and relevant to readers in the twenty-first century. AJ Cronin’s tale is one of many of the hardships of coal-mining communities during the industrial pre-war, World War I, and interwar periods in Britain, but stands out for its unflinching prose, universal themes, and keen storytelling. The novel was adapted into a 1940 film starring Michael Redgrave as Davey Fenwick, is a New York Times Critics’ Pick, and is included in the New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780795345456'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0795345453'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",657.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.8.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SGaEDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SGaEDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SGaEDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+STARS+LOOK+DOWN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=SGaEDAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+STARS+LOOK+DOWN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Stars_Look_Down.html?hl=&id=SGaEDAAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The Last Puritan,['George Santayana'],Bradford Books,1995,"A novel of of ideas, expressed in the birth, life, and early death of Oliver Alden. Published in 1935, George Santayana's The Last Puritan was the American philosopher's only novel. It became an instant best-seller, immediately linked in its painful voyage of self discovery to The Education of Henry Adams. It is essentially a novel of ideas, expressed in the birth, life, and early death of Oliver Alden.The Last Puritan is volume four in a new critical edition of The Works of George Santayana that restores Santayana's original text and provides important new scholarly information. Books in this series - the first complete publication of Santayana's works - include an editorial apparatus with notes to the text (identifying persons, places, and ideas), textual commentary (including a description of the composition and publication history, along with a discussion of editorial methods and decisions), discussions of adopted readings, lists of variants and emendations, and line-end hyphenations. Irving Singer's new introduction to this edition takes up Santayana's philosophical and artistic concerns, including issues of homosexuality raised by the depiction of the novel's two protagonists, Oliver and Mario, and of the relationship between Oliver and the rogue character Jim Darnley. In his thoughtful analysis Singer finds the term ""homosexual novel"" too reductionist and imprecise for what Santayana is trying to achieve. Singer brings to light the author's skillful and inventive methods for perceiving and interpreting reality, including ideal forms of friendship, and his success in exploring the pervasive moral problems that people face throughout their existence.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0262691787'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780262691789'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",630.0,BOOK,['Philosophy'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2JzuwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2JzuwQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2JzuwQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LAST+PURITAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2JzuwQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LAST+PURITAN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Last_Puritan.html?hl=&id=2JzuwQEACAAJ,,,A Memoir in the Form of a Novel,,

Drums Along the Mohawk,['Walter D. Edmonds'],Vintage,2015-02-03,"The bestselling novel behind John Ford’s acclaimed film starring Claudette Colbert, Henry Fonda, and Edna May Oliver. When newlyweds Gilbert and Lana Martin settle in the Mohawk Valley in 1776, they work tirelessly against the elements to build a new life. But even as they clear land and till soil to establish their farm, the shots of the Revolutionary War become a rallying cry for both the loyalists and the patriots. Soon, Gil and Lana see their neighbors choose sides against each other—as British and Iroquois forces storm the valley, targeting anyone who supports the revolution. Originally published in 1936, this classic novel was a bestseller for two years—second only to Gone with the Wind—and was adapted into a motion picture in 1939. Now, some three-quarters of a century later, Drums Along the Mohawk stands as a brilliant account of the majesty of the New York frontier, the timeless rhythms that shape a marriage, and the battles of a revolution that would change the world. Foreword by Diana Gabaldon Vintage Movie Classics spotlights classic films that have stood the test of time, now rediscovered through the publication of the novels on which they were based.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101872680'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101872683'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",656.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g0xABAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g0xABAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=g0xABAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DRUMS+ALONG+THE+MOHAWK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g0xABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g0xABAAAQBAJ,,,A Vintage Movie Classic,,

The Years,['Annie Ernaux'],Seven Stories Press,2017-11-21,"WINNER OF THE 2022 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE Shortlisted for the 2019 Man Booker International Prize Considered by many to be the iconic French memoirist's defining work and a breakout bestseller when published in France in 2008 The Years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present—even projections into the future—photos, books, songs, radio, television and decades of advertising, headlines, contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries. Local dialect, words of the times, slogans, brands and names for the ever-proliferating objects, are given voice here. The voice we recognize as the author's continually dissolves and re-emerges. Ernaux makes the passage of time palpable. Time itself, inexorable, narrates its own course, consigning all other narrators to anonymity. A new kind of autobiography emerges, at once subjective and impersonal, private and collective. On its 2008 publication in France, The Years came as a surprise. Though Ernaux had for years been hailed as a beloved, bestselling and award-winning author, The Years was in many ways a departure: both an intimate memoir ""written"" by entire generations, and a story of generations telling a very personal story. Like the generation before hers, the narrator eschews the ""I"" for the ""we"" (or ""they"", or ""one"") as if collective life were inextricably intertwined with a private life that in her parents' generation ceased to exist. She writes of her parents' generation (and could be writing of her own book): ""From a common fund of hunger and fear, everything was told in the ""we"" and impersonal pronouns.""

The Outward Room,['Millen Brand'],New York Review of Books,2010-10-19,"The Outward Room is a book about a young woman’s journey from madness to self-discovery. It created a sensation when it was first published in 1937, and has lost none of its immediacy or its power to move the reader. Having suffered a nervous breakdown after her brother’s death in a car accident, Harriet Demuth is committed to a mental hospital, but her doctor’s Freudian nostrums do little to make her well. Convinced that she and she alone can refashion her life, Harriet makes a daring escape from the hospital—hopping a train by night and riding the rails into the vastness of New York City in the light of the rising sun. It is the middle of the Great Depression, and at first Harriet is lost among the city’s anonymous multitudes. She pawns her jewelry and lives an increasingly hand-to-mouth existence until she meets John, a machine-shop worker. Slowly Harriet begins to recover her sense of self; slowly she and John begin to fall in love. The story of that emerging love, told with the lyricism of Virginia Woolf and the realism of Theodore Dreiser, is the heart of Millen Brand’s remarkable book.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781590174074'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1590174070'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",304.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.7.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eUK7m7kLVjIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eUK7m7kLVjIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eUK7m7kLVjIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+OUTWARD+ROOM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eUK7m7kLVjIC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eUK7m7kLVjIC,,,,,
I Can Get It for You Wholesale,['Jerome Weidman'],Open Road Media,2013-03-26,"New York Times–bestselling author: The classic comic story of a con man out to pull the job of a lifetime in New York’s Garment District. Just south of Times Square, more than six thousand manufacturers of dresses are crammed into the few blocks that make up Manhattan’s garment district. Their factories are cramped, noisy, and incredibly profitable—and Harry Bogen is going to take them for all they’re worth. A classic conniver, he knows that it’s easier, and a hell of a lot more fun, to turn a buck by lying than by telling the truth. First he convinces the shipping clerks—the pack animals of the garment industry—to go on strike. With the dress manufacturers brought to their knees, Harry will be there to pick them up again. His conscience might be conflicted, if he had one in the first place. A bracing comic sensation when first published, I Can Get It for You Wholesale remains a timeless masterpiece—its hero still a scoundrel, and his charm as irresistible as ever.

Fearless -- foolhardy -- imaginative -- swayed by passions and moods, he plays the game of the Revolutionary forces in various capacities, under various aliases, finds conflict between his love and his loyalties and the ideals win.

To Have and Have Not,['Ernest Hemingway'],Simon and Schuster,2002-07-25,"From one of the best writers in American literature, a classic novel about smuggling, intrigue, and love. To Have and Have Not is the dramatic story of Harry Morgan, an honest man who is forced into running contraband between Cuba and Key West as a means of keeping his crumbling family financially afloat. His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who throng the region and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair. In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. By turns funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact, To Have and Have Not is literary high adventure at its finest.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780743237345'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '074323734X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",177.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.15.14.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6FonetSiO_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6FonetSiO_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6FonetSiO_oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TO+HAVE+AND+HAVE+NOT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6FonetSiO_oC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6FonetSiO_oC,4.5,2.0,,,

For the Love of My Son,['Margaret Davis'],Hachette UK,2011-09-15,"This is the story of an ordinary woman whose grief - and love - for her only son compelled her to do something extraordinary. When Margaret Davis's beloved son Steven was murdered by his own wife, a Philippino former prostitute, she travelled across continents to track down her son's killers and bring them to justice, and to rescue her grandchildren. Based on Margaret's own diaries, notes and emails, this tells not only the awful but utterly compelling story of her perilous journey, but also of how she has dealt with her crippling grief, and how she has striven to save and protect two small children caught up in the violent crossfire of their parents' failing marriage. It is a tale of two cultures that clashed, with terrible results. And it is a tale of how one mother, faced with her worst nightmare, has fought for justice for her son and some kind of healing for herself and the others left behind after his appalling death.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781444718386'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '144471838X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",152.0,BOOK,['Biography & Autobiography'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z35nY-K4qx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z35nY-K4qx4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z35nY-K4qx4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MY+SON,+MY+SON!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z35nY-K4qx4C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z35nY-K4qx4C,,,,,
The Wall,['Marlen Haushofer'],Cleis Press,2011-06-11,"“I can allow myself to write the truth; all the people for whom I have lied throughout my life are dead…” writes the heroine of Marlen Haushofer’s The Wall, a quite ordinary, unnamed middle-aged woman who awakens to find she is the last living human being. Surmising her solitude is the result of a too successful military experiment, she begins the terrifying work of not only survival, but self-renewal. The Wall is at once a simple and moving talk – of potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one’s name – and a disturbing meditation on 20th century history.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781573449151'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1573449156'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",252.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],MATURE,True,2.9.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q7QF1JXNPG4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q7QF1JXNPG4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=q7QF1JXNPG4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+WALL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=q7QF1JXNPG4C&dq=intitle:THE+WALL&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Wall.html?hl=&id=q7QF1JXNPG4C,,,,,

Dynasty of Death,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2016-11-15,"Two families grow a small munitions factory into a global empire in this saga by a New York Times–bestselling author spanning from 1837 to the eve of World War I. In 1837, Joseph Barbour, an upper servant in an English village, immigrates with his family to America so he can make his fortune in the nascent artillery business. A man of vision, Joseph foresees a time when wars will not be won with courage and brave hearts but rather by the nations with superior firearms. Joseph and his family settle in a rural Pennsylvania village, but his wife, Hilda, is unhappy and longs to return to England. Their shy and sensitive younger son, Martin, is also homesick, but what troubles him most is the cruelty and violence he sees in his older brother, Ernest. Martin’s fears come to fruition when Joseph forms a gunpowder firm with Armand Bouchard, who lives with his wife and three sons down the road from the Barbours. As the years pass, Ernest proves himself invaluable to Barbour & Bouchard. Ruthless and ambitious, he takes what he wants. But beautiful Amy Drumhill continues to elude him and becomes the catalyst in a war that will estrange the two brothers and leave Ernest haunted by the blood that will be forever on his hands. Dynasty of Death is a moving saga of two families, the epic struggle between two brothers, and the legacy their guns will leave the world as mighty enemy nations gear up for battle.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504039031'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504039033'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",830.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.29.24.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ms9SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ms9SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ms9SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DYNASTY+OF+DEATH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ms9SDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ms9SDQAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The Grapes of Wrath,['John Steinbeck'],Penguin,2006-03-28,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers. First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. This Centennial edition, specially designed to commemorate one hundred years of Steinbeck, features french flaps and deckle-edged pages. For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781440637124'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1440637121'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",530.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.15.13.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ClXiwSYzjtYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ClXiwSYzjtYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ClXiwSYzjtYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+GRAPES+OF+WRATH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ClXiwSYzjtYC&dq=intitle:THE+GRAPES+OF+WRATH&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Grapes_of_Wrath.html?hl=&id=ClXiwSYzjtYC,4.0,2.0,,,

How Green Was My Valley,['Richard Llewellyn'],Rosetta Books,2013-04-18,"The international-bestselling winner of the National Book Award and the basis for the Academy Award–winning film directed by John Ford. Huw Morgan remembers the days when his home valley was prosperous, verdant, and beautiful—before the mines came to town. The youngest son of a respectable mining family in South Wales, he is now the only one left in the valley, and his reminiscences tell the story of a family and a town both defined and ruined by the mines. Huw’s story is both joyful and heartrending—a portrait of a place and a people existing now only in memory. Full of memorable characters, richly crafted language, and surprising humor, How Green Was My Valley is the first of four books chronicling Huw’s life, including the sequels Up into the Singing Mountain, Down Where the Moon is Small, and Green, Green My Valley Now. “The reader emerges from these tense pages strangely aglow with sharing the happiness of the characters . . .

Notes of a Native Son,['James Baldwin'],Beacon Press,2012-11-20,"#26 on The Guardian's list of 100 best nonfiction books of all time, the essays explore what it means to be Black in America In an age of Black Lives Matter, James Baldwin's essays on life in Harlem, the protest novel, movies, and African Americans abroad are as powerful today as when they were first written. With films like I Am Not Your Negro and the forthcoming If Beale Street Could Talk bringing renewed interest to Baldwin's life and work, Notes of a Native Son serves as a valuable introduction. Written during the 1940s and early 1950s, when Baldwin was only in his twenties, the essays collected in Notes of a Native Son capture a view of black life and black thought at the dawn of the civil rights movement and as the movement slowly gained strength through the words of one of the most captivating essayists and foremost intellectuals of that era. Writing as an artist, activist, and social critic, Baldwin probes the complex condition of being black in America. With a keen eye, he examines everything from the significance of the protest novel to the motives and circumstances of the many black expatriates of the time, from his home in “The Harlem Ghetto” to a sobering “Journey to Atlanta.” Notes of a Native Son inaugurated Baldwin as one of the leading interpreters of the dramatic social changes erupting in the United States in the twentieth century, and many of his observations have proven almost prophetic. His criticism on topics such as the paternalism of white progressives or on his own friend Richard Wright’s work is pointed and unabashed. He was also one of the few writing on race at the time who addressed the issue with a powerful mixture of outrage at the gross physical and political violence against black citizens and measured understanding of their oppressors, which helped awaken a white audience to the injustices under their noses. Naturally, this combination of brazen criticism and unconventional empathy for white readers won Baldwin as much condemnation as praise. Notes is the book that established Baldwin’s voice as a social critic, and it remains one of his most admired works. The essays collected here create a cohesive sketch of black America and reveal an intimate portrait of Baldwin’s own search for identity as an artist, as a black man, and as an American.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780807006238'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0807006238'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",209.0,BOOK,['Literary Criticism'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jNpmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jNpmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jNpmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NATIVE+SON&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jNpmDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:NATIVE+SON&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Notes_of_a_Native_Son.html?hl=&id=jNpmDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Kings Row,['Henry Bellamann'],Rare Treasure Editions,2021-11-09T20:55:00Z,"This is Henry Bellamann's wonderful novel that many call a lost American classic. Despite being a critical and commercial success on its release in 1940, leading to a film version with Ronald Reagan two years later, King's Row and the rest of Bellamann's works are largely forgotten today. This is unfortunate, as King's Row is a novel that should be richly appreciated both for the skill of its construction and the richness of its ideas. It's an important novel from a cultural and historical context, and there's nothing else quite like it. At first, King's Row almost seems as if it could pass as just another slice of small town Americana, no more daring or cutting than a Norman Rockwell painting -- a safer and gentler Peyton Place. However, as the story unfolds, it reveals surprising depths of darkness, using beautiful prose to reveal some very ugly truths about the human mind and the civilization that it creates.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781774644041'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1774644045'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",812.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HT9NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HT9NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HT9NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:KING%27S+ROW&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HT9NEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HT9NEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Real Mrs Miniver,['Ysenda Maxtone Graham'],St. Martin's Press,2014-05-13,"In 1937 the Court Page of the London Times began publishing a series of articles featuring a charming, upper-middle class English housewife named Mrs Miniver. The articles depicted an idyllically happy family with three children, a house in London, and a country cottage called Starlings. Two years later, Mrs Miniver was published in book form. While some critics derided the book as sentimental, many readers embraced it as a symbol of an increasingly endangered English way of life, and it went on to become the #1 bestseller in America. The Hollywood film, released in 1942 with Greer Garson in the title role, won five Oscars, including Best Picture, and did so much to promote the American war effort in Europe that even Josef Goebbels recognized it as an exemplary piece of propaganda. But who was the real Mrs Miniver? The articles were produced by Joyce Maxtone Graham, who wrote under the name Jan Struther and seemed to resemble her heroine: She was upper-middle class, and lived in a gracious, comfortable home with her husband and three children. After the war broke out, she served as an unofficial ambassador from Great Britain to the U.S. In truth, however, Jan Struther was not at all like the conventional Mrs Miniver. It wasn't merely that she didn't like tea--to the amazement of everyone in America--but her real life was neither simple nor saintly.

You Can't Go Home Again,['Thomas Wolfe'],Simon and Schuster,2011-10-11,"Now available from Thomas Wolfe’s original publisher, the final novel by the literary legend, that “will stand apart from everything else that he wrote” (The New York Times Book Review)—first published in 1940 and long considered a classic of twentieth century literature. A twentieth-century classic, Thomas Wolfe’s magnificent novel is both the story of a young writer longing to make his mark upon the world and a sweeping portrait of America and Europe from the Great Depression through the years leading up to World War II. Driven by dreams of literary success, George Webber has left his provincial hometown to make his name as a writer in New York City. When his first novel is published, it brings him the fame he has sought, but it also brings the censure of his neighbors back home, who are outraged by his depiction of them. Unsettled by their reaction and unsure of himself and his future, Webber begins a search for a greater understanding of his artistic identity that takes him deep into New York’s hectic social whirl; to London with an uninhibited group of expatriates; and to Berlin, lying cold and sinister under Hitler’s shadow. He discovers a world plagued by political uncertainty and on the brink of transformation, yet he finds within himself the capacity to meet it with optimism and a renewed love for his birthplace. He is a changed man yet a hopeful one, awake to the knowledge that one can never fully “go back home to your family, back home to your childhood…away from all the strife and conflict of the world…back home to the old forms and systems of things which once seemed everlasting but which are changing all the time.”","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781451650501'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1451650507'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",658.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.8.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-8JzHJaxhooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-8JzHJaxhooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-8JzHJaxhooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:YOU+CAN%27T+GO+HOME+AGAIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-8JzHJaxhooC&dq=intitle:YOU+CAN%27T+GO+HOME+AGAIN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/You_Can_t_Go_Home_Again.html?hl=&id=-8JzHJaxhooC,,,,,
Foundation Stone,['Lella Warren'],University of Alabama Press,1986-03-30,"Using the history of Alabama and the stories of her pioneering ancestors, Lella Warren created the Whetstone clan who settled Alabama in the 1820s, helped lead it into the prosperity of the 1850s, and fought for it in the War Between the States. The historical background of Foundation Stone is authentic, but, more, it is a compelling story about believable characters. The story of these people—three generations of Whetstones—captures the American pioneering spirit. As an unidentified reviewer described the novel, “Lella Warren’s ‘Foundation Stone’ is the long, well-told chronicle of a family that loved and hoped and struggled in a difficult world, unaware that they symbolized an era and a way of life.” Foundation Stone was published in September 1940 and was on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list September 1940-February 1941, along with Hemingway’s For Whom the Bell Tolls and Wolfe’s You Can’t Go Home Again.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780817302887'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0817302883'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",673.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1X4CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K1X4CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=K1X4CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FOUNDATION+STONE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=K1X4CQAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:FOUNDATION+STONE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Foundation_Stone.html?hl=&id=K1X4CQAAQBAJ,,,,,

For Whom the Bell Tolls,['Ernest Hemingway'],Simon and Schuster,2014-05-22,"In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,” Maxwell Perkins wrote to Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no one ever so completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author's previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476770116'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476770115'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",516.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TdVQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TdVQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=TdVQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT8&dq=intitle:FOR+WHOM+THE+BELL+TOLLS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TdVQAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TdVQAQAAQBAJ,4.0,1.0,,,

Whistle Stop,['Philip White'],ForeEdge from University Press of New England,2014-11-04,"President Harry Truman was a disappointment to the Democrats, and a godsend to the Republicans. Every attempt to paint Truman with the grace, charm, and grandeur of Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been a dismal failure: Truman's virtues were simpler, plainer, more direct. The challenges he faced--stirrings of civil rights and southern resentment at home, and communist aggression and brinkmanship abroad--could not have been more critical. By the summer of 1948 the prospects of a second term for Truman looked bleak. Newspapers and popular opinion nationwide had all but anointed as president Thomas Dewey, the Republican New York Governor. Truman could not even be certain of his own party's nomination: the Democrats, still in mourning for FDR, were deeply riven, with Henry Wallace and Strom Thurmond leading breakaway Progressive and Dixiecrat factions. Finally, with ingenuity born of desperation, Truman's aides hit upon a plan: get the president in front of as many regular voters as possible, preferably in intimate settings, all across the country. To the surprise of everyone but Harry Truman, it worked. Whistle Stop is the first book of its kind: a micro-history of the summer and fall of 1948 when Truman took to the rails, crisscrossing the country from June right up to Election Day in November. The tour and the campaign culminated with the iconic image of a grinning, victorious Truman holding aloft the famous Chicago Tribune headline: ""Dewey Defeats Truman.""","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781611684537'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1611684536'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",341.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4P8eBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4P8eBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4P8eBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA151&dq=intitle:WHISTLE+STOP&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4P8eBQAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:WHISTLE+STOP&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Whistle_Stop.html?hl=&id=4P8eBQAAQBAJ,,,"How 31,000 Miles of Train Travel, 352 Speeches, and a Little Midwest Gumption Saved the Presidency of Harry Truman",,

The Seventh Cross,['Anna Seghers'],Hachette UK,2018-05-22,"'At once a suspenseful manhunt story and a knowing portrait of the perils of ordinary life in Hitler's Germany, The Seventh Cross is not only an important novel, but an important historical document. This new, unabridged translation is a genuine publishing event' - Joseph Kanon, author of 'The Good German' and 'Leaving Berlin' 'A masterpiece. Written in the midst of terror, but with such clarity, such acuity; Seghers is a writer of rare insight' RACHEL SEIFFERT author of A Boy in Winter Seven prisoners escape from Westhofen concentration camp. Seven crosses are erected in the grounds and the commandant vows to capture the fugitives within a week. Six men are caught quickly, but George Heisler slips through his pursuers' fingers. It becomes a matter of pride to track him down, at whatever cost. Who can George trust? Who will betray him? The years of fear have changed those he knew best: his brother is now an SS officer; his lover turns him away. Hunted, injured and desperate, time is running out for George, and whoever is caught aiding in his escape will pay with their life. The Seventh Cross is one of the most powerful and influential novels of the twentieth century, a tense thriller that helped to alert the world to the grim realities of Nazi Germany. 'It was [Seghers] who taught my generation and anyone who had an ear to listen after that not-to-be-forgotten war to distinguish right from wrong. The Seventh Cross shaped me; it sharpened my vision' GUNTER GRASS 'A fascinating insight into life in pre-war Nazi Germany just as the horrors of the Nazi regime were beginning to unfold. This is an important novel, as much for its picture of German society as for its insight into the psyche of ordinary people confronting their personal fears and mixed loyalties' SIMON MAWER, author of The Glass Room In The Seventh Cross, Seghers's aim was to write, 'A tale that makes it possible to get to know the many layers of fascist Germany through the fortunes of a single man.' She had four copies of the manuscript: one was destroyed in an air raid; a friend lost the second copy while fleeing the Nazis; another was found by the Gestapo; only the fourth copy survived, which, fortunately, she sent to her publisher in America just before she escaped Nazi-occupied France. Published in 1942, The Seventh Cross was an immediate bestseller and was the basis for an MGM film starring Spencer Tracy in 1944. It has been translated into more than 40 languages. Margot Bettauer Dembo's expert new translation makes the complete text of this great political novel available in English for the first time.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780349010403'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0349010404'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",416.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7IMkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7IMkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7IMkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+SEVENTH+CROSS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IMkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7IMkDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Robe,['Lloyd C. Douglas'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2012-05-17,"More than 6 million copies sold! The classic Christian novel of the crucifixion and one Roman soldier’s transformation through faith. At the height of his popularity, Lloyd C. Douglas was receiving an average of one hundred letters a week from fans. One of those fans, a department store clerk in Ohio named Hazel McCann, wrote to Douglas asking what he thought had happened to Christ’s garments after the crucifixion. Douglas immediately began working on The Robe, sending each chapter to Hazel as he finished it. It is to her that Douglas dedicated this book. A Roman soldier wins Christ’s robe as a gambling prize. He then sets forth on a quest to find the truth about the Nazarene—a quest that reaches to the very roots and heart of Christianity. Here is the fascinating story of this young Roman soldier, Marcellus, who was in charge at the crucifixion of Jesus. After he won Christ’s robe in a game of dice on Calvary, he experienced a slow and overpowering change in his life. Through the pages of this great book, the reader sees how a pagan Roman was eventually converted to Christ. Set against the vividly drawn background of ancient Rome, this is a timeless story of adventure, faith, and romance, a tale of spiritual longing and ultimate redemption . . .","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780544050020'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0544050029'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",723.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.7.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QLPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QLPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QLPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+ROBE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QLPqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QLPqDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Citizen Tom Paine,['Howard Fast'],Open Road Media,2011-12-13,"The New York Times bestseller that’s “so glowingly human a picture of Tom Paine and America in the revolutionary days” (The New York Herald). Thomas Paine’s voice rang in the ears of eighteenth-century revolutionaries from America to France to England. He was friend to luminaries such as Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and William Wordsworth. His pamphlets extolling democracy sold in the millions. Yet he died a forgotten man, isolated by his rough manners, idealistic zeal, and unwillingness to compromise. Howard Fast’s brilliant portrait brings Paine to the fore as a legend of American history, and provides readers with a gripping narrative of modern democracy’s earliest days in America and Europe.

Forever Amber,['Kathleen Winsor'],Chicago Review Press,2012-02-01,"Abandoned pregnant and penniless on the teeming streets of London, 16-year-old Amber St. Clare manages, by using her wits, beauty, and courage, to climb to the highest position a woman could achieve in Restoration England—that of favorite mistress of the Merry Monarch, Charles II. From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary—and extraordinary—men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have. Frequently compared to Gone with the Wind, Forever Amber is the other great historical romance, outselling every other American novel of the 1940s—despite being banned in Boston for its sheer sexiness.

The Green Years,['A. J. Cronin'],Pan Macmillan,2013-03-14,"Originally published in 1945, The Green Years is one of A J Cronin’s best-loved novels. It tells the story of Robert Shannon, a young Irish Catholic boy, who, orphaned at the age of seven, is brought to live with his mother’s estranged family in Scotland. As he grows up in a dour Presbyterian town, only his great-grandfather, an incorrigible, swaggering, charming, larger-than-life character, seems able to rescue him from the narrow interests of the people who try to shape his life in their own image. Disappointed in love and in his burning ambition to study medicine, the eighteen-year-old Robert sees his future as a blank wall. But, once again, he is saved from despair by his fiery relative, much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. This compassionate story of a boy’s growth to manhood, set against the harsh reality of life at the turn of the century, shows A J Cronin at his masterly best, creating a vivid gallery of characters with his customary blend of imagination, insight and tenderness.

Cannery Row,['John Steinbeck'],Penguin,1993-02-01,"Steinbeck’s tough yet charming portrait of people on the margins of society, dependant on one another for both physical and emotional survival A Penguin Classic Published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is: both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual. Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “Scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed . . . and, at the darkest level . . . the terror of isolation and nothingness.” For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

"Georgi Stoikov Rakovski, a Great Son of Bulgaria and a Great Friend of India","['Veselin Nikolov Traĭkov', 'G. Mukherjee']",Northern Book Centre,1987*,"A biographical sketch of Georgi Stoikov Rakovski who is widely known in Bulgaria as the founder of the organized Bulgarian National Liberation Movement. His activity is closely connected with the whole new stage in the history of the Bulgarian National Revival. This passionate and ardent revolutionary was a versatile personality; a poet, Downalist, historian, ethnographer, numismatist, diplomat, student of folklore, linguist. In addition to this, his efforts to establish unity and understanding among the Balkan nations made him one of the most outstanding politicians of the Balkans in the middle of the 19th century. Rakovski was the first in Europe to create a consciousness about Hindustan. Eversince 1857, the fountainhead of Indian studies in Eastern Europe he did significant work in Sanskrit literature, philosophy and folklore, ethnography and numismatics. A glowing tribute to Rakovski, the work explores what he left behind. A detailed study of his single-handed contribution in the field of Indology that can be a matter of pride for any cultural centre. This book is a biographical sketch of Georgi Stoikov Rakovski who firmly believed that the source of all the civilizations of the world is India. Though brought up in the tradition of Hellenic culture, he was drawn to the culture and literature of India. He translated a part of the Ramayana. It was as early as 1857 that he published in his newspaper a series of reports about the struggle of the Indian people, about their resistance to the oppresser. Itâ€™s as far back as 130 years he wrote in his paper â€œIndia must belong to the people of India and not to England, sooner or later, this must be soâ€ . This book pays a glowing tribute to Rakovski and explores in detail his single handed contribution in the field of Indology and Balkan studies. It can be a matter of pride and research for any centre of Indology and Balkan studies. Reviews G. Mukerjee writes about Rakovskiâ€™s role in bringing home to his countrymen the great civilization of India and its struggle for freedom from the British. The book makes it clear that Bulgaria owes a great deal to his patriot. Pavanmeet Sethy, Patriot, New Delhi, 4 Oct., 1987. A book like this jointly authored by Veselin Traikov and G. Mukerjee, the noted Indian Scholar on Eastern Europe, is particularly welcome because it portrays objectively the life of Georgi Stoikov Rakovski, an extraordinary revolutionary who defied all resistance from the weilders of political power. It also describes important aspects of his ideas and ideals with which India came to be related quite deeply. ``... Rakovskiâ€™s researches were remarkable and one hopes there will be no dearth of scholars in this country to start again from where Rakovski left''. Biswajit Ray, Amrita Bazar Patrika, Calcutta, 2 August, 1987. This is a holy and precious book and I shall read it with great interest â€œthis precious book will have a place of honour in our libarary.....â€ Devika Rani, Bangalore. ``I would like to assure you that the book is very interesting and useful and its publication will strengthen the bonds of friendship between India and Bulgarian People''. L. Darkim, Charge of Affairs a.i., Embassy of India, Sofia. ``Georgi Stoikov Rakovski was born in April 1821 in Kotel in a family of old revolutionary traditions and a spirit of independence. It was as early as 1857 that he published a series of reports about the struggles of the Indian people and their resistance to the British Oppressors. He wrote in his paper regarding the struggle of 1857, ``India must be free'' and ``India must belong to the people of India and not to England.'' Although he was brought up in the traditions of Hellenic Culture, he was drawn to the culture and literature of India. He translated a part of the Ramayana. Indeed, in the history of Indo-Bulgarian relations, the name of Georgi Stoikov Rakovski towers over all as one of the greatest friends of India.

The Wide House,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2018-09-04,"An “intimately limned” saga of passion and greed in the decade before the Civil War—from the New York Times–bestselling author of Captains and the Kings (Kirkus Reviews). The Wide House is the story of two cousins from Ireland: Stuart Coleman, a shopkeeper who dreams of building a big white house and raising a family, and Janie Cauder, a young widow with four children, only one of whom she truly adores. When Janie arrives in Grandeville, New York, the two begin a surprising romance—but happiness is not to be their fate. Driven by ambition and haunted by self-doubt, Stuart spurns Janie for the beautiful daughter of a business rival. Janie, meanwhile, takes her disappointment out on her children and pursues new romantic opportunities—to diminishing returns. As the national mood turns increasingly antagonistic to outsiders, Stuart and Janie’s inability to love will leave a bitter mark on their lives, and on generations to come. A richly detailed portrait of a fascinating time in American history, The Wide House is a masterwork from an author whose “sheer power” has captivated millions of readers all over the world (The New York Times).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504053167'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504053168'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",733.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.7.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+WIDE+HOUSE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZiJiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZiJiDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Jerome Lindsey and his foster brother, Alfred, couldn’t be more different. The son of a wealthy banker in upstate New York, Jerome leaves home for a life of extravagance and adventure, seducing countless women along the way. Meanwhile, Alfred becomes an executive at the family bank and his adoptive father’s heir apparent. After his wife dies, Alfred shows little interest in remarrying—until he meets Amalie Maxwell, the ravishing and headstrong daughter of a tenant farmer. Fearing that his inheritance is at stake, Jerome returns home to expose Amalie as a shameless gold digger. But the more he schemes against her, the closer he’s drawn to her. Now, Jerome and Amalie will discover the thin line between love and hate—and that a moment of passion can have a lifetime’s worth of consequences.

Around the corner from the elegant townhouses on Albion Place is Britannia Mews, a squalid neighborhood where servants and coachmen live. In 1875, it’s no place for a young girl of fine breeding, but independent-minded Adelaide Culver is fascinated by what goes on there. Years later, Adelaide shocks her family when she falls in love with an impoverished artist and moves into the mews. But violence shatters Adelaide’s dreams. In a dangerous new world, she must fend for herself—until she meets a charismatic stranger and her life takes a turn she never expected. A novel about social manners and mores reminiscent of Edith Wharton, this story of love, family, and the price one must pay for throwing off the shackles of convention is also a witty and incisive dissection of the “upstairs, downstairs” English class system of the last two centuries.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504034241'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504034244'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",338.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.22.19.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FyifCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FyifCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FyifCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BRITANNIA+MEWS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FyifCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FyifCwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The East River,"['Erik Baard', 'Thomas Jackson', 'Richard Melnick']",Arcadia Publishing,2005,"The East River captures the history of New York's premier waterway. The river, a source of life for Native Americans, spawned communities from Brooklyn to Harlem. Its shipyards and docks projected American enterprise around the world. The waterfront, an industrial and commercial dynamo, forged a continent. The dreams of immigrants who arrived and lived on its banks created this nation.

The Naked and the Dead,['Norman Mailer'],Penguin UK,2018-11-01,"Based on Mailer's own experience of military service in the Philippines during World War Two, The Naked and the Dead' is a graphically truthful and shattering portrayal of ordinary men in battle. First published in 1949, as America was still basking in the glories of the Allied victory, it altered forever the popular perception of warfare. Focusing on the experiences of a fourteen-man platoon stationed on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific during World War II, and written in a journalistic style, it tells the moving story of the soldiers' struggle to retain a sense of dignity amidst the horror of warfare, and to find a source of meaning in their lives amisdst the sounds and fury of battle.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780241340509'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0241340500'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",688.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+NAKED+AND+THE+DEAD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=l4lZDwAAQBAJ,,,,,
De strijd om Sam-Peony-bridge,['Paul Nowee'],Overamstel Uitgevers,2015-02-12,"De rijke Sam Peony overlijdt op 86-jarige leeftijd. De man, die vlak bij het dorpje Hourglass woonde, heeft zijn hele leven gestreden voor een brug over het meer dat zijn huis scheidde van Hourglass. Zijn wens ging echter nooit in vervulling... In zijn testament leest men echter dat hij een groot deel van zijn bezittingen nalaat aan de Hourglass, maar met als voorwaarde dat... ""zijn brug"" er binnen een jaar komt. Er worden meteen plannen gemaakt voor de bouw, want met de grond die Sam hen heeft nagelaten kunnen ze eindelijk een station bouwen vlak bij hun dorp, en hoeven ze niet meer steeds naar het nabijgelegen Fallon. Hourglass gaat een zonnige toekomst tegemoet, hopen ze... Er wordt begonnen met de bouw van de brug. Op de één of andere raadselachtige manier gaat er echter steeds iets mis. Dat er opzet in het spel is, is duidelijk, maar de sheriff kan weinig doen in zijn eentje. Op voorstel van de Rechter van Hourglass wordt besloten om de hulp van Arendsoog in te roepen... Arendsoog stemt in en na een bewogen reis bereikt hij Hourglass. Zijn komst is duidelijk al aan de vijand gemeld, want de bode die hem de brief kwam brengen was heel iemand anders dan degene die door de Rechter was aangewezen... Arendsoog stelt een onderzoek in, maar heeft het niet makkelijk. Alle sporen leiden naar Fallon, maar daar worden ze niet veel wijzer. Zullen onze vrienden dit avontuur toch tot een goed einde weten te brengen? Je leest het in deze spannende Arendsoog!","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789049910839'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9049910831'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",116.0,BOOK,['Juvenile Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wVdwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wVdwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wVdwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:PEONY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wVdwBgAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:PEONY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/De_strijd_om_Sam_Peony_bridge.html?hl=&id=wVdwBgAAQBAJ,,,,,

She knew she had to have him for herself, and, despite her family’s religious beliefs , their shocked disapproval, and all she had been taught was her destiny, she was determined to fight for him.

Tomorrow Will Be Better,['Betty Smith'],HarperCollins,2020-11-24,"""A rediscovered treasure."" — Maureen Corrigan, Washington Post From Betty Smith, author of the beloved classic A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, comes a poignant story of love, marriage, poverty, and hope set in 1920s Brooklyn. Tomorrow Will Be Better tells the story of Margy Shannon, a shy but joyfully optimistic young woman just out of school who lives with her parents and witnesses how a lifetime of hard work, poverty, and pain has worn them down. Her mother's resentment toward being a housewife and her father's inability to express his emotions result in a tense home life where Margy has no voice. Unable to speak up against her overbearing mother, Margy takes refuge in her dreams of a better life. Her goals are simple—to find a husband, have children, and live in a nice home—one where her children will never know the terror of want or the need to hide from quarreling parents. When she meets Frankie Malone, she thinks her dreams might be fulfilled, but a devastating loss rattles her to her core and challenges her life-long optimism. As she struggles to come to terms with the unexpected path her life has taken, Margy must decide whether to accept things as they are or move firmly in the direction of what she truly wants. Rich with the flavor of its Brooklyn background, and filled with the joys and heartbreak of family life, Tomorrow Will Be Better is told with a simplicity, tenderness, and warmhearted humor that only Betty Smith could write.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062988690'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062988697'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",311.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TOMORROW+WILL+BE+BETTER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The Young Lions,['Irwin Shaw'],Open Road Media,2013-02-26,"One of the great World War II novels, this New York Times–bestselling “masterpiece” captures the experiences of three very different soldiers (The Boston Globe). Standing alongside Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones’s From Here to Eternity, The Young Lions is one of the most powerful American novels to tackle the Second World War. Ambitious in its scope and robust in its prose, Irwin Shaw’s work is also deeply humanistic, presenting the reality of war as seen through the eyes of ordinary soldiers on both sides. The story follows the individual dramas—and ultimately intertwined destinies—of Christian Diestl, a Nazi sergeant; Noah Ackerman, a Jewish American infantryman; and Michael Whitacre, an idealistic urbanite from the New York theatrical world. Diestl first appears as a dashing ski instructor in Austria, mouthing his loyalty to Nazi ideals. As the war progresses, Diestl’s character continues to erode as he descends into savagery. Ackerman must endure domestic anti-Semitism and beatings in boot camp before proving himself in the European theater. Eventually, as part of the liberating army, he comes face-to-face with the unimaginable horrors of the death camps. Whitacre, trading cocktail parties for Molotov cocktails, confronts the barbarism of war, and in fighting simply to survive, finds his own capacity for heroism. Shaw’s sweeping narrative is at once vivid, exciting, and brutally realistic as well as poignant in its portrayal of the moral devastation and institutional insanity of war. Penned by a master storyteller at the height of his craft, The Young Lions stands the test of time as a classic novel of war and the human experience. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Irwin Shaw including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s estate.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781480408104'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1480408107'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",615.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.31.33.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+YOUNG+LIONS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=baJMV9qRvoQC,,,A Novel,,

Kay: Now, Pops, please. If we're going -- Mr. Banks: -- and what's his last name? I hope it's better than his first one. Kay: Pops, I'm not going to sit here -- Mr. Banks: -- and where the hell does he come from -- and who does he think is going to support him? If it's me he's got another guess coming. And who in God's name -- To say the least, Mr. Banks isn't taking it well, and to make matters worse, he must host cocktail parties with the in-laws-to-be, initiate financial planning talks with Buckley, and moderate family conferences on who will be invited to the reception. Who can blame him when he sinks so low as to offer Kay $1500 to elope? But Mr. Banks holds his peace, and when the last wedding guest has departed from his confetti-matted house, he has his memories, and you have a merry record of his tribulations.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780684863542'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0684863545'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",248.0,BOOK,['Fathers and daughters'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.2.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sargctOgkuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sargctOgkuQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sargctOgkuQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FATHER+OF+THE+BRIDE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sargctOgkuQC&dq=intitle:FATHER+OF+THE+BRIDE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Father_of_the_Bride.html?hl=&id=sargctOgkuQC,,,,,
On Nineteen Eighty-Four,"['Abbott Gleason', 'Jack Goldsmith', 'Martha C. Nussbaum']",Princeton University Press,2010-07-28,"George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is among the most widely read books in the world. For more than 50 years, it has been regarded as a morality tale for the possible future of modern society, a future involving nothing less than extinction of humanity itself. Does Nineteen Eighty-Four remain relevant in our new century? The editors of this book assembled a distinguished group of philosophers, literary specialists, political commentators, historians, and lawyers and asked them to take a wide-ranging and uninhibited look at that question. The editors deliberately avoided Orwell scholars in an effort to call forth a fresh and diverse range of responses to the major work of one of the most durable literary figures among twentieth-century English writers. As Nineteen Eighty-Four protagonist Winston Smith has admirers on the right, in the center, and on the left, the contributors similarly represent a wide range of political, literary, and moral viewpoints. The Cold War that has so often been linked to Orwell's novel ended with more of a whimper than a bang, but most of the issues of concern to him remain alive in some form today: censorship, scientific surveillance, power worship, the autonomy of art, the meaning of democracy, relations between men and women, and many others. The contributors bring a variety of insightful and contemporary perspectives to bear on these questions.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781400826643'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1400826640'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",328.0,BOOK,['Political Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vynzZcvqmVgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vynzZcvqmVgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vynzZcvqmVgC&pg=PA109&dq=intitle:NINETEEN+EIGHTY-FOUR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vynzZcvqmVgC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vynzZcvqmVgC,,,Orwell and Our Future,,
Let Love Come Last,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2018-09-04,"The “deeply engrossing” saga of a 19th-century lumber baron’s twisted love for his family—from the #1 New York Times–bestselling author of Captains and the Kings (The New York Times). Born into the humblest of circumstances, William Prescott is determined to amass a fortune large enough to ensure that his four children will never want for anything. He’ll do whatever it takes to achieve his goal, even if it means plundering Pennsylvania’s forests of every last tree and destroying anyone who stands in his way. As William’s business empire grows, so too does his insatiable need to be loved and admired. William’s wife, Ursula, tries to fill their ostentatious home with warmth and common sense, but her efforts are destined to backfire. The children resent her for trying to discipline them, and William’s ambition blinds him to any point of view but his own. Only when two of his spoiled children plot against him does William realize that the ties that bind the Prescott family have become warped beyond recognition. A riveting drama with a powerful message, Let Love Come Last is a masterwork from an author who “never falters when it comes to storytelling” (Publishers Weekly).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504053105'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504053109'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",563.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.10.11.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XiJiDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:LET+LOVE+COME+LAST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiJiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiJiDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Parasite Rex,['Carl Zimmer'],Simon and Schuster,2000-09-21,"Combining the literary sensibility of David Quammen with the scientific rigor of Stephen Jay Gould, Carl Zimmer reveals the power, danger, and beauty of the surprising creatures who dominate the earth: parasites. For centuries, parasites have lived in nightmares, horror stories, and the darkest shadows of science. In Parasite Rex, Carl Zimmer takes readers on a fantastic voyage into the secret universe of these extraordinary life-forms—which are not only among the most highly evolved on Earth, but make up the majority of life’s diversity. Traveling from the steamy jungles of Costa Rica to the parasite-riddled war zone of southern Sudan, Zimmer introduces an array of amazing creatures that invade their hosts, prey on them from within, and control their behavior. He also vividly describes parasites that can change DNA, rewire the brain, make men more distrustful and women more outgoing, and turn hosts into the living dead. This comprehensive, gracefully written book brings parasites out into the open and uncovers what they can teach us all about the most fundamental survival tactics in the universe—the laws of Parasite Rex.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780743213714'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0743213718'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",336.0,BOOK,['Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.15.14.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ev1gm3U6rQIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ev1gm3U6rQIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ev1gm3U6rQIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+PARASITES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ev1gm3U6rQIC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ev1gm3U6rQIC,,,Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures,,

The Song of the Cardinal,['Gene Stratton-Porter'],Jazzybee Verlag,2017-02-06,"""The Song of the Cardinal"" is a fascinating story of the life of a redbird, or Kentucky cardinal, as it is popularly called, who is born in the valley of the Wabash. The author possesses the soul of an artist and a poet, which enables her to invest the story with the charm of a rich and vivid imagination; while her knowledge of the habits and peculiarities of the redbird and the love she feels for the cardinal family impart a living interest to her work that makes the reader enter into the joys and tribulations, the triumphs, failures, and final victory of the hero, with much the same personal interest one feels in the leading figures of a well-told romance of life. Into the web and woof of the story the author has also woven a beautiful picture of an old man and woman who through the song and the presence of the cardinal are brought again into the loving, sympathetic nearness to each other that marked the golden days of their early married life.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783849648619'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3849648613'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",133.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tLUVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tLUVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=tLUVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+CARDINAL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tLUVDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tLUVDgAAQBAJ,,,,,
Jubilee Trail,['Gwen Bristow'],Open Road Media,2014-05-20,"A willful New York debutante travels the rugged Great Plains for a future in the flourishing American West in this New York Times bestseller. Charting the trail across the Great Plains from New York City to the Mexican territory of California, a headstrong couple embarks on a new life in this classic work of historical fiction as unforgiving, moving, and unpredictable as the frontier. A recent finishing school graduate, eighteen-year-old Garnet Cameron is desperate for direction. Too driven for the restrictive manners of the upper class, Garnet is naturally drawn to Oliver Hale, a frontier trader. Unlike the men Garnet is accustomed to, Oliver treats her as his equal and respects her independence. His tales of adventure on the plains thrill her. And his proposal of marriage is accepted. Garnet eagerly grabs hold of the promise and prospect of an exciting future, only to discover how ill-prepared she is for the punishing landscape of the Jubilee Trail and the even harsher realities of human nature. Adapted into a feature film, Jubilee Trail is a classic novel of a woman in the West, beloved not only for the rebelliousness and resilience of its heroine, but for its authenticity, grand sweep, unsparing intimacy, and honest portrayal of the survivors and victims—as well as the victors and villains—of a defiant American wilderness.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781480485143'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1480485144'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",840.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.21.20.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=intitle:JUBILEE+TRAIL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Across the River and Into the Trees,['Ernest Hemingway'],Simon and Schuster,1998-04-15,"In the fall of 1948, Ernest Hemingway made his first extended visit to Italy in thirty years. His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him ""the most important author since Shakespeare.""","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780684844640'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0684844648'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",274.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.5.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vYPNBLcwhDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vYPNBLcwhDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vYPNBLcwhDMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ACROSS+THE+RIVER+AND+INTO+THE+TREES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vYPNBLcwhDMC&dq=intitle:ACROSS+THE+RIVER+AND+INTO+THE+TREES&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Across_the_River_and_Into_the_Trees.html?hl=&id=vYPNBLcwhDMC,,,,,

From Here to Eternity,['J.E. Smyth'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-07-25,"From Here to Eternity (1953) is one of the most controversial films of its time. Adapted from James Jones's bestselling novel, the landmark blockbuster deals frankly with adultery, military corruption, physical abuse, racism and murder, and traces the unhappy lives of five American outsiders in the last days before Pearl Harbor. Made at the height of the Cold War and Hollywood's anticommunist purges, director Fred Zinnemann, writer Daniel Taradash and producer Buddy Adler defied military and industry pressure to censor the material. Exploring the film's full production history and drawing upon archival documents and rare interviews with cast and crew, J. E. Smyth provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the film many industry insiders thought couldn't be made.

"Melville Goodwin, USA",['John P. Marquand'],Open Road Media,2015-07-14,"Finalist for the National Book Award: This sweeping novel set in the aftermath of World War II reveals the story behind the creation of an American icon Major General Melville A. Goodwin, the son of a druggist, served in two world wars, rising through the ranks to take command of an armored division. He was a hero long before he braved a hail of bullets to save a fellow American in postwar Berlin, but until that mad act of courage, no one outside of the military had ever heard of him. That is all about to change: A weekly news magazine has convinced the major general to sit down for an extended interview at the home of Sid Skelton, a popular radio commentator and former army buddy of Goodwin’s. Over the course of many hours, Goodwin tells the story of his life—from his small-town childhood to his years at West Point, his battlefield traumas, his marriage to an ambitious woman who helped shape his military career, and his impressions of the world as seen through the barbed wire of far-flung army posts. Of primary interest to Skelton, however, is Dottie Peale, the vivacious journalist Goodwin romanced in war-torn France. Skelton is a little bit in love with her himself, and now that the major general is in the news, Dottie plans to make a dramatic return to his life. At the moment of his greatest triumph, Goodwin will discover that his marriage and career are under threat.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504015752'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504015754'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",481.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.21.20.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MELVILLE+GOODWIN,+USA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kHqrCQAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

East of Eden,['John Steinbeck'],Penguin,2002-02-05,"A masterpiece of Biblical scope, and the magnum opus of one of America’s most enduring authors, in a commemorative hardcover edition In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden ""the first book,"" and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. The masterpiece of Steinbeck’s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean, and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah’s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781440631320'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1440631328'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",612.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.20.18.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:EAST+OF+EDEN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C&dq=intitle:EAST+OF+EDEN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/East_of_Eden.html?hl=&id=OPy6E5ZhXs0C,4.5,13.0,,,

The Illustrated Battle Cry of Freedom,['James M. McPherson'],Oxford University Press,2003-12-11,"Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War. James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom,"" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780199743902'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0199743908'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",947.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.19.13.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BATTLE+CRY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GXfGuNAvm7AC,3.5,15.0,The Civil War Era,,

Beyond This Place,['A. J. Cronin'],Pan Macmillan,2013-03-14,"Paul Mathry, a student about to graduate and embark upon a teaching career, finds out that his father was convicted for murder, a secret that his mother had hidden from him since his childhood. Driven by an intense desire to see his father, Paul sets out to visit him in prison, only to find out that visitors are never allowed there. From there, he meets the primary witnesses in the case that convicted his father, not all of whom are supportive to Paul's cause. He encounters several dead ends but he persists, with the help of a store girl named Lena and a news reporter. His persistent campaign finally bears fruit. Rees Mathry, Paul's father, goes on appeal and is vindicated. The novel ends with Paul's father, a hardened, cynical man, seeing a fleeting hope for self-renewal and a purposeful life. In the magnificent narrative tradition of The Citadel, The Stars Look Down and Cronin’s other classic novels, Beyond This Place is a great book by a much-loved author.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781447243830'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1447243838'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.7.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eJU595zFsS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eJU595zFsS0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eJU595zFsS0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BEYOND+THIS+PLACE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eJU595zFsS0C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eJU595zFsS0C,,,,,

"Never Victorious, Never Defeated",['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2018-10-02,"New York Times Bestseller: A sprawling epic of an American railroad dynasty’s “sensational intrigues and stormy struggles for power” (The New York Times Book Review). Founded in Portersville, Pennsylvania, in the latter days of Andrew Jackson’s presidency, the Interstate is a small regional railroad with vast potential. Also, it is the birthright of Aaron deWitt’s sons: ruthless yet charming Rufus and stubborn, idealistic Stephen. When Stephen wins control of the Interstate, his victory starts a series of events that will roil the deWitt family for generations. Over decades, the Interstate grows into an enterprise capable of shaping the future of the nation. Yet, both its triumphs and defeats sow the seeds of the deWitt family’s downfall. Brothers plot against brothers, sons demean fathers, wives betray husbands—all in pursuit of monumental power. Not even Cornelia, Rufus’s beautiful and cunning daughter, can ensure that the deWitt family name won’t disappear. Spanning nearly a century, Never Victorious, Never Defeated is a brilliant dramatization of the lives of America’s robber barons and further proof that Taylor Caldwell “never falters when it comes to storytelling” (Publishers Weekly).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504053204'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504053206'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",768.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.10.10.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WypnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WypnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WypnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NEVER+VICTORIOUS,+NEVER+DEFEATED&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WypnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WypnDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The View from Pompey's Head,['Hamilton Basso'],LSU Press,1998-11-01,"Sweet, sleepy -- beautiful -- old Pompey's Head, South Carolina. Anson Page thought he'd ground it out of his life for good. Now a Manhattan lawyer representing a large publishing house, he's returning to his hometown after fifteen years to investigate the mystery surrounding one of his client's authors, a major American novelist who lives on nearby Tamburlaine Island. Both painfully familiar and irrevocably altered, the landmarks and people in Pompey's Head resurrect for Page the sweep of his past life. As he sets about resolving business matters, he collides headlong with the enduring power of lineage to determine belonging and dominance, exclusion and shame, and the realization that leaving does not mean escaping.A deft interlacing of recollection and suspense, The View from Pompey's Head is Hamilton Basso's most popularly acclaimed novel.

"Sincerely, Willis Wayde",['John P.

His father is an engineer at Harcourt Mill, and Willis is awestruck by the family’s wealth and power. Seeking guidance from Henry Harcourt, Willis meets Bess, the old man’s granddaughter. Their friendship eventually blossoms into love as the elder Harcourt takes the young man under his wing, recognizing in Willis a kindred spirit whose instinct for making money matches his own. Pleased with his good fortune, Willis is nevertheless acutely aware of the great social gulf that separates the Waydes from the Harcourts. Determined to make his own way, he sets out on a path that will take him far beyond New England and the insular, old-money world of Henry and Bess. Then the Depression hits, wiping out the Harcourt family fortune. When he comes back into their life, Willis has the power to rescue the last vestige of the family’s prestige: the mill. Torn between his nostalgia for a simpler, more sentimental time and his sharply honed business acumen, Willis must make a fateful decision.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504015769'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504015762'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",399.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.18.19.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2nqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2nqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2nqrCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SINCERELY,+WILLIS+WAYDE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2nqrCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2nqrCQAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,['Sloan Wilson'],Hachette UK,2009-03-17,"Universally acclaimed when first published in 1955, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit captured the mood of a generation. Its title -- like Catch-22 and Fahrenheit 451 -- has become a part of America's cultural vocabulary. Tom Rath doesn't want anything extraordinary out of life: just a decent home, enough money to support his family, and a career that won't crush his spirit. After returning from World War II, he takes a PR job at a television network. It is inane, dehumanizing work. But when a series of personal crises force him to reexamine his priorities -- and take responsibility for his past -- he is finally moved to carve out an identity for himself. This is Sloan Wilson's searing indictment of a society that had just begun to lose touch with its citizens. The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit is a classic of American literature and the basis of the award-winning film starring Gregory Peck.

The Horrors of Andersonville,['Catherine Gourley'],Twenty-First Century Books ™,2014-08-01,"The Confederate prison known as Andersonville existed for only the last fourteen months of the Civil War―but its well-documented legacy of horror has lived on in the diaries of its prisoners and the transcripts of the trial of its commandant. The diaries describe appalling conditions in which vermin-infested men were crowded into an open stockade with a single befouled stream as their water source. Food was scarce and medical supplies virtually nonexistent. The bodies of those who did not survive the night had to be cleared away each morning. Designed to house 10,000 Yankee prisoners, Andersonville held 32,000 during August 1864. Nearly a third of the 45,000 prisoners who passed through the camp perished. Exposure, starvation, and disease were the main causes, but excessively harsh penal practices and even violence among themselves contributed to the unprecedented death rate. At the end of the war, outraged Northerners demanded retribution for such travesties, and they received it in the form of the trial and subsequent hanging of Captain Henry Wirz, the prison’s commandant. The trial was the subject of legal controversy for decades afterward, as many people felt justice was ignored in order to appease the Northerners’ moral outrage over the horrors of Andersonville. The story of Andersonville is a complex one involving politics, intrigue, mismanagement, unfortunate timing, and, of course, people - both good and bad. Relying heavily on first-person reports and legal documents, author Catherine Gourley gives us a fascinating look into one of the most painful incidents of U.S. history.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781467776325'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1467776327'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",192.0,BOOK,['Young Adult Nonfiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YJ5XBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YJ5XBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YJ5XBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ANDERSONVILLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YJ5XBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YJ5XBAAAQBAJ,,,Life and Death Inside a Civil War Prison,,

The Last Hurrah,"[""Edwin O'Connor""]",University of Chicago Press,2016-04-25,"A corrupt mayor runs his final campaign in this “remarkably intelligent, informed, well-conceived, and highly readable” classic novel (Chicago Tribune). “We’re living in a sensitive age, Cuke, and I’m not altogether sure you’re fully attuned to it.” So says Irish-American politician Frank Skeffington—a cynical, corrupt 1950s mayor, and also an old-school gentleman who looks after the constituents of his New England city and enjoys their unwavering loyalty in return. But in our age of dynasties, mercurial social sensitivities, and politicians making love to the camera, Skeffington might as well be talking to us. Not quite a roman á clef of notorious Boston mayor James Michael Curley, The Last Hurrah tells the story of Skeffington’s final campaign as witnessed through the eyes of his nephew, who learns a great deal about politics as he follows his uncle to fundraisers, wakes, and into smoke-filled rooms, ultimately coming—almost against his will—to admire the man. Adapted into a 1958 film starring Spencer Tracy and directed by John Ford (and which Curley tried to keep from being made), Edwin O’Connor’s opus reveals politics as it really is, and big cities as they really were. An expansive, humorous novel offering deep insight into the Irish-American experience and the ever-changing nature of the political machine, The Last Hurrah reveals political truths still true today: what the cameras capture is just the smiling face of the sometimes sordid business of giving the people what they want. Praise for The Last Hurrah “The best novel about American politics and the best novel about Irish-Americans I have ever read.” —New York Times “A splendid inside job on big city politics.

Imperial Women,['S.E. Wood'],BRILL,2018-07-17,"From the end of the Roman Republic to the death of the last Julio-Claudian emperor, portraits of women - on coins, public monuments, and private luxury objects - became an increasingly familiar sight throughout the empire. These women usually represented the distinguished bloodlines of the head of the state, or his hopes for succession, but in every case, their images were freighted with political significance. These objects also communicated social messages about the appropriate roles, behavior, and self-presentation of women. This volume traces the emergence and development of the public female portrait, from Octavia, the first Roman woman to be represented in propria persona on coinage, to the formidable and ambitious Agrippina the Younger, whose assassination demonstrated to later women the limits of official power they could demand.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789004351288'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9004351280'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",501.0,BOOK,['Literary Criticism'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfh5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cfh5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cfh5DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:IMPERIAL+WOMAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cfh5DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:IMPERIAL+WOMAN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Imperial_Women.html?hl=&id=cfh5DwAAQBAJ,,,"A Study in Public Images, 40 B.C. - A.D. 68, Revised edition",,
Lucy Crown,['Irwin Shaw'],Open Road Media,2013-04-16,"A New York Times bestseller from an author with “a natural gift for storytelling”: A mother and son are reunited years after a shattering betrayal (The New York Times). She passes through the Paris restaurant, alone, unbent, and unbroken. Lucy Crown has lived with heartbreak for long enough that it no longer shows on her face, and she’s not afraid to dine in solitude. But then she sees him across the bar, full of liquor and life, looking far happier than he did the last time she saw him two decades before: Tony, her son—the one man she loved more than any other, the one she nearly destroyed. Twenty years earlier, in 1937, Lucy was an unhappily married suburban housewife, and Tony was so frail his parents were forced to hire a companion for him. When the companion caught Lucy’s eye, he awoke in her a feeling of passion she thought had died long ago—leading to an act of indiscretion during a vacation in Vermont that would upend their family, and take half a lifetime to repair. From the author of such classics as Rich Man, Poor Man and The Young Lions—an O. Henry Award winner who “always writes immensely readable books”—Lucy Crown is an unflinching look at the emotional reality of infidelity, heartbreak, and divorce that remains a testament to the power of forgiveness (The New York Times). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Irwin Shaw including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s estate.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781480412415'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1480412414'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",408.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.18.17.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YlPFmAzI_FQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YlPFmAzI_FQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YlPFmAzI_FQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:LUCY+CROWN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YlPFmAzI_FQC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YlPFmAzI_FQC,,,A Novel,,

Papa Aubrey’s wife and twin daughters, Mary and Rose, are piano prodigies, his young son Richard Quin is a lively boy, and his eldest daughter Cordelia is a beautiful and driven young woman with musical aspirations. But the talented and eccentric Aubrey family rarely enjoys a moment of harmony, as its members struggle to overcome the effects of their patriarch’s spendthrift ways.

In sensuous language textured with the cadences of Creole speech, these stories vividly evoke a world where pride, injustice, love, and unexpected changes of fortune leave their mark but cannot extinguish the human spirit. When her past lover returns to Jamaica with his Irish bride, a successful businesswoman must contend with her old flame’s renewed courtship. A well-known chanteuse with humble beginnings tells a young female reporter the tale of her life’s great turnaround. In the Pushcart Prize-winning story “By Love Possessed,” Goodison reveals the melancholy and resilience of a woman whose illusions about her dream man come to a disturbing and abrupt end. With warm humour, empathy, and an unsentimental and perceptive eye for the foibles of human relationships, Goodison immerses us into the lives of an unforgettable community of people as they face challenges both intensely private and universally recognizable.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780771035722'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0771035721'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",272.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,2.5.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=APkfcy0YF5oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=APkfcy0YF5oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=APkfcy0YF5oC&pg=PT34&dq=intitle:BY+LOVE+POSSESSED&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=APkfcy0YF5oC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=APkfcy0YF5oC,,,Stories,,

Another son, Geoffrey, died before his parents, but left 2 children: Arthur and Eleanor. And thereby hangs this tale. The historical record relates that after the death of Richard Lionheart, the evil John usurped the throne that should have gone to his older brother Geoffrey's son Arthur, and that to solidfy his claim, he murdered Arthur and swept Eleanor into a convent, where she was never to be seen or heard from again. In this wonderful, imaginative book, the author keeps to most of the historical record, but asserts that after the death of her brother, Arthur, Eleanor was spirited away to safety by William the Marshal. The story starts in the present day, and details the efforts of a descendent of Marshal to find the lineal descendent of Eleanor, who would be the de jure Queen of England. The story weaves back and forth between the present day and 13th century England, and is absolutely riveting. If you like English history, and especially if you like what-if situations, this is a great book.""","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UOM:39015013095297'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",492.0,BOOK,['Great Britain'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.4.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ&q=intitle:BELOW+THE+SALT&dq=intitle:BELOW+THE+SALT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ&dq=intitle:BELOW+THE+SALT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Below_the_Salt.html?hl=&id=8_FJAAAAMAAJ,,,A Novel,,

The Winthrop Woman,['Anya Seton'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2014-04-22,"Colonial America holds friendship, hardship, and love for a bold woman in this classic historical romance from the bestselling author of Green Darkness. In 1631 Elizabeth Winthrop, newly widowed with an infant daughter, set sail for the New World. Against a background of rigidity and conformity she dared to befriend Anne Hutchinson at the moment of her banishment from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; dared to challenge a determined army captain bent on the massacre of her friends the Siwanoy Indians; and, above all, dared to love a man as her heart and her whole being commanded. And so, as a response to this almost unmatched courage and vitality, Governor John Winthrop came to refer to this woman in the historical records of the time as his “unregenerate niece.” Anya Seton’s riveting historical novel portrays the fortitude, humiliation, and ultimate triumph of the Winthrop woman, who believed in a concept of happiness transcending that of her own day. “The Winthrop Woman is that rare literary accomplishment—living history. Really good fictionalized history [like this] often gives closer reality to a period than do factual records.”—Chicago Tribune “A rich and panoramic narrative full of gusto, sentimentality and compassion.

The King Must Die,['Mary Renault'],Vintage,1988-02-12,"In this ambitious, ingenious narrative, celebrated historical novelist Mary Renault take legendary hero Theseus and spins his myth into a fast-paced and exciting story. Renault starts with Theseus' early years, showing how the mystery of his father's identity and his small stature breed the insecurities that spur his youthful hijinx. As he moves on to Eleusis, Athens, and Crete, his playfulness and fondness for pranks matures into the courage to attempt singular heroic feats, the gallantry and leadership he was known for on the battlefield, and the bold-hearted ingenuity he shows in navigating the labyrinth and slaying the Minotaur. In what is perhaps the most inventive of all her novels of Ancient Greece, Renault casts Theseus in a surprisingly original pose; she teases the flawed human out of the bronze hero, and draws the plausible out of the fantastic.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0394751043'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780394751047'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",354.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QbKra7KV-QUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QbKra7KV-QUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QbKra7KV-QUC&q=intitle:THE+KING+MUST+DIE&dq=intitle:THE+KING+MUST+DIE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QbKra7KV-QUC&dq=intitle:THE+KING+MUST+DIE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_King_Must_Die.html?hl=&id=QbKra7KV-QUC,,,A Novel,,

Lady Chatterley's Lover (The Unexpurgated Edition),['D. H. Lawrence'],DigiCat,2023-12-29,"This carefully crafted ebook: ""Lady Chatterley's Lover (The Unexpurgated Edition)"" is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. This novel by D. H. Lawrence was first published in 1928 and subsequently banned. Lady Chatterley's Lover is one of the most subversive novels in English Literature. The first edition was printed privately in Florence, Italy, with assistance from Pino Orioli; an unexpurgated edition could not be published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960. (A private edition was issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929.) The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex, and its use of then-unprintable words. Lady Chatterley's Lover was inspired by the long-standing affair between Frieda, Lawrence's German wife, and an Italian peasant who eventually became her third husband; Lawrence's struggle with sexual impotence; and the circumstances of his and Frieda's courtship and the early years of their marriage.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'EAN:8596547768142'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",411.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_yTmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_yTmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_yTmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:LADY+CHATTERLY%27S+LOVER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_yTmEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_yTmEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Cave Painters,['Gregory Curtis'],Anchor,2008-12-10,"The Cave Painters is a vivid introduction to the spectacular cave paintings of France and Spain—the individuals who rediscovered them, theories about their origins, their splendor and mystery. Gregory Curtis makes us see the astonishing sophistication and power of the paintings and tells us what is known about their creators, the Cro-Magnon people of some 40,000 years ago. He takes us through various theories—that the art was part of fertility or hunting rituals, or used for religious purposes, or was clan mythology—examining the ways interpretations have changed over time. Rich in detail, personalities, and history, The Cave Painters is above all permeated with awe for those distant humans who developed—perhaps for the first time—both the ability for abstract thought and a profound and beautiful way to express it.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307482709'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307482707'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",298.0,BOOK,['Art'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.6.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZoAFc2Nv9b8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZoAFc2Nv9b8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZoAFc2Nv9b8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+CAVE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZoAFc2Nv9b8C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZoAFc2Nv9b8C,,,Probing the Mysteries of the World's First Artists,,
Dear and Glorious Physician,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2024-04-23,"A bestseller “alive with the bustle of ancient times” that “movingly reconstructs St. Luke’s search for God” (The New York Times). Two millennia ago, a Greek man known as Lucanus traveled to Alexandria to study medicine. He would become one of the greatest doctors of his time and heal the sick all throughout the Mediterranean world. But his extraordinary work as a physician is not his greatest legacy. Today he is known around the world as St. Luke—author of the third Gospel of the New Testament. He never laid eyes on Jesus, but he heard about Christ’s life and death, and saw God in Him. He retraced Jesus’s steps and sought out those who had known Him—including His mother, Mary. The resulting account is a cornerstone of Christianity and world history. From the celebrated author of Captains and the Kings and Great Lion of God comes this stirring and deeply inspiring story, counted “among the bestselling religious novels of all time” (The New York Times Book Review). “A portrait so moving and so eloquent I doubt it is paralleled elsewhere in literature.” —Boston Herald “Magnificent. . . .

The War Lover,['John Hersey'],Vintage,2019-09-04,"In the immediate sense, this long, eventful and agonizingly suspenseful novel shows what fear, secret hidden fear, can do to even one of those seeming heroes, a war lover. In the longer view, however, this may come to be regarded as the great and ultimate anti-war novel of our time. The scene is an American bomber base in England sometime before D-Day. The characters are the crew of a Flying Fortress named The Body, particularly the pilot, Buzz Marrow, and the co-pilot, Boman, who tells the story of his worship of Marrow, and of how his hero succumbed, on their final crucial mission, to the fatal weakness with which he camouflaged his fear—his secret delight in annihilation. Boman also tells the story of the English girl he loved (and Mr. Hersey’s many admirers will note a new tenderness and passion in these scenes), and of her fateful intervention in Marrow’s collapse. Both narrative lines flow together and are superbly united in the sustained and powerful climax.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780593080887'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0593080882'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",416.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mgOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mgOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mgOhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+WAR+LOVER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mgOhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mgOhDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

A Burnt-Out Case,['Graham Greene'],Open Road Media,2018-04-10,"A famous architect struggling with a crisis of faith escapes to a leper colony in the Congo, in Graham Greene’s “greatest novel” (Time). Querry is a world-renowned architect noted for his magnificent churches, each designed not for the glory of God, but for the satisfaction of self. Suddenly infected with indifference, he has abandoned his pursuit of pleasure. Now he has reached the end of desire at the end of the world—a colony of lepers in the remote jungles of Africa. Here, under the guidance of Doctor Colin, a fellow atheist, Querry’s consideration of the sick could be something close to a cure for his own suffering. So too, it first seems, could a local plantation owner’s lonely and abused wife—Querry’s unlikely confessor. But when Querry reluctantly agrees to build a hospital and his good intentions brand him a modern-day saint, all the intrusive and dangerous piety of civilization returns. And this time it could be inescapable. From “the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man’s consciousness and anxiety” comes Graham Greene’s celebrated novel about the consequences of conviction, the sickness of the soul, and the tenuous endurance of the human spirit (William Golding).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504052504'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504052501'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",219.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.13.12.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ieBUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ieBUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ieBUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+BURNT-OUT+CASE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ieBUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ieBUDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Fox in the Attic,['Richard Hughes'],New York Review of Books,2012-08-29,"A tale of enormous suspense and growing horror, The Fox in the Attic is the widely acclaimed first part of Richard Hughes’s monumental historical fiction, “The Human Predicament.” Set in the early 1920s, the book centers on Augustine, a young man from an aristocratic Welsh family who has come of age in the aftermath of World War I. Unjustly suspected of having had a hand in the murder of a young girl, Augustine takes refuge in the remote castle of Bavarian relatives. There his hopeless love for his devout cousin Mitzi blinds him to the hate that will lead to the rise of German fascism. The book reaches a climax with a brilliant description of the Munich putsch and a disturbingly intimate portrait of Adolph Hitler. The Fox in the Attic, like its no less remarkable sequel The Wooden Shepherdess, offers a richly detailed, Tolstoyan overview of the modern world in upheaval. At once a novel of ideas and an exploration of the dark spaces of the heart, it is a book in which the past returns in all its original uncertainty and strangeness.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781590175316'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '159017531X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",344.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,2.5.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9AGVGNifMLYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9AGVGNifMLYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9AGVGNifMLYC&dq=intitle:THE+FOX+IN+THE+ATTIC&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9AGVGNifMLYC&dq=intitle:THE+FOX+IN+THE+ATTIC&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fox_in_the_Attic.html?hl=&id=9AGVGNifMLYC,,,,,
The Bull from the Sea,['Mary Renault'],,1962,"""The Bull from the Sea"" is the story of Theseus, King of Athens, but also Mary Renault's brilliant historical reconstruction of ancient Greek politics. Throughout his reign, Theseus is torn between his genius for kingship and his truant craving for adventure. As Theseus for a dynastic marriage with Phaedra, Pirithoos, the pirate prince, lures him off to explore the unknown Euxine, where he meets and captures the young warrior priestess Hippolyta. She is the love of his life, and that love is the crux of his fate. The bull of Marathon, the battle of the Lapiths and Kentaurs, and the moon-goddess cult of Pontos are merely a portion of the legendary material that Renault weaves into the fabric of great historical fiction. Whether or not these myths have their far-distant origin in actual events, the author's imagination and scholarship have invested them with immediate amd magical reality.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0140034021'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780140034028'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",244.0,BOOK,"['Dissertations, Academic']",NOT_MATURE,False,0.4.2.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H3Db3_FeiQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H3Db3_FeiQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=H3Db3_FeiQ0C&q=intitle:THE+BULL+FROM+THE+SEA&dq=intitle:THE+BULL+FROM+THE+SEA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=H3Db3_FeiQ0C&dq=intitle:THE+BULL+FROM+THE+SEA&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bull_from_the_Sea.html?hl=&id=H3Db3_FeiQ0C,,,,,

The Prize,['Daniel Yergin'],Simon and Schuster,2011-04-05,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and hailed as “the best history of oil ever written” by Business Week, Daniel Yergin’s “spellbinding…irresistible” (The New York Times) account of the global pursuit of oil, money, and power addresses the ongoing energy crisis. Now with an epilogue that speaks directly to the current energy crisis, The Prize recounts the panoramic history of the world’s most important resource—oil. Daniel Yergin’s timeless book chronicles the struggle for wealth and power that has surrounded oil for decades and that continues to fuel global rivalries, shake the world economy, and transform the destiny of men and nations. This updated edition categorically proves the unwavering significance of oil throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first by tracing economic and political clashes over precious “black gold.” With his far-reaching insight and in-depth research, Yergin is uniquely positioned to address the present battle over energy which undoubtedly ranks as one of the most vital issues of our time. The canvas of his narrative history is enormous—from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Operation Desert Storm, and both the Iraq War and current climate change. The definitive work on the subject of oil, The Prize is a book of extraordinary breadth, riveting excitement, and great value—crucial to our understanding of world politics and the economy today—and tomorrow.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781439134832'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1439134839'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",929.0,BOOK,['Political Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.11.14.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WiUTwBTux2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WiUTwBTux2oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WiUTwBTux2oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+PRIZE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WiUTwBTux2oC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WiUTwBTux2oC,4.0,7.0,"The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power",,

A Shade of Difference,['Allen Drury'],WordFire +ORM,2014-05-01,"Racial tensions threaten to sink the US in this sequel to the Pulitzer Prize–winning Advise and Consent from the #1 New York Times–bestselling author. From Allen Drury, the twentieth-century grand master of political fiction, comes a novel of the United Nations and the racial friction that could spark a worldwide powder keg. International tensions rise as ambassadors and politicians scheme, using the independence of a small African nation as the focal point for hidden agendas. A cascade of events begun in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations could lead to the weakening of the United States, the loss of the Panama Canal, and a possible civil war. Allen Drury paints a vivid and laser-accurate portrait of Washington and international politics, from top secret conferences, to elite cocktail parties, club luncheon rooms, and the private offices of the key players in government. Praise for Allen Drury and A Shade of Difference “On every page you hear the drums of jeopardy. This is a measure of Mr. Drury’s mastery. He has a remarkable skill for keeping not only his characters but also his readers in dramatic turmoil. There are hardly any bystanders in his dramatis personae.” —The New York Times “The market that found Advise and Consent enormously readable will take this in stride. Here is another contemporary-and beyond-novel dealing with the chitchat as well as the more profound thoughts on issues that are with us—yesterday, today, tomorrow.” —Kirkus Reviews “Drury’s stories are detailed and compelling portraits of the machinery of government as relevant today as when they were first published.” —HuffPost","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781614751267'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1614751269'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",1042.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.5.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VoF5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VoF5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VoF5EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+SHADE+OF+DIFFERENCE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VoF5EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VoF5EAAAQBAJ,,,,,

A glass-blower, remember, breathes life into a vessel, giving it shape and form and sometimes beauty; but he can with that same breath, shatter and destroy it' Faithful to her word, Sophie Duval reveals to her long-lost nephew the tragic story of a family of master craftsmen in eighteenth-century France. The world of the glass-blowers has its own traditions, it's own language - and its own rules. 'If you marry into glass' Pierre Labbe warns his daughter, 'you will say goodbye to everything familiar, and enter a closed world'. But crashing into this world comes the violence and terror of the French Revolution against which, the family struggles to survive.

City of Night,['John Rechy'],"Grove/Atlantic, Inc.",2013-11-12,"“[Rechy’s] tone rings absolutely true, is absolutely his own. . . . He tells the truth, and tells it with such passion that we are forced to share in the life he conveys. . . . This is a most humbling and liberating achievement.”—James Baldwin When John Rechy’s explosive first novel appeared in 1963, it marked a radical departure in fiction, and gave voice to a subculture that had never before been revealed with such acuity. It earned comparisons to Genet and Kerouac, even as Rechy was personally attacked by scandalized reviewers. Nevertheless, the book became an international bestseller, and fifty years later, it has become a classic. Bold and inventive in style, Rechy is unflinching in his portrayal of one hustling “youngman” and his search for self-knowledge within the neon-lit world of hustlers, drag queens, and the denizens of their world, as he moves from El Paso to Times Square, from Pershing Square to the French Quarter. Now including never-seen original marked galley pages and an interview with the author, Rechy’s portrait of the edges of America has lost none of its power to move and exhilarate.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780802121530'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0802121535'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",514.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],MATURE,False,0.3.0.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UavGAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UavGAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UavGAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CITY+OF+NIGHT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UavGAgAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:CITY+OF+NIGHT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/City_of_Night.html?hl=&id=UavGAgAAQBAJ,,,,,

Decisions of the World Court Relevant to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,['Barbara Kwiatkowska'],BRILL,2002-05-01,"This pioneering publication provides A Reference Guide to the significant contributions of decisions of the World Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations and the world's most senior Court with the broadest material jurisdiction, to the development of the law of the sea as a part of the global system of peace and security. The Guide is dedicated to the Court's former President Stephen M. Schwebel in appreciation of his belief that it is important for the Court to further explore its pre-eminently unique role throughout the Third Millennium. Whereas the format of specific entries covered by this Reference Guide largely corresponds to the Parts and Annexes of the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS) and the 1994 Part XI Agreement, the heading of each entry also contains, as appropriate, references to the 1930 League of Nations Hague Draft, the four 1958 UN Geneva Conventions and the 1995 UN Straddling Stocks Agreement, as well as to the 1972 UN Stockholm, the 1992 Rio UNCED and the 2002 Johannesbourg instruments. This will enable the reader to relate the Court's decisions to the respective UNCLOS provisions as originated from and as implemented by these global framework instruments at various stages of codification and progressive development of the law of the sea. The entries cover principally Judgments and Orders (including the related pleadings) of the PCIJ and the ICJ and those decisions of Arbitral Tribunals and other third party fora as well as national courts which have been relied upon in the Court's jurisprudence. In addition, the recent decisions of the ITLOS and some other fora, such as the Annex VII Southern Bluefin Tuna, Singapore v. Malaysia, Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana/Suriname and the Mox Plant Arbitral Tribunals, as well as references to treaties are also listed under specific entries as appropriate. Tables of Cases and Treaties will importantly facilitate the use of A Reference Guide. It has proven to be an indispensable tool for the Judges and governmental and other practitioners in furthering the coherent development of the law of the sea by international courts and tribunals on the one hand, and for international community of academics in the adequate assessing of this development on the other hand.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789047403111'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9047403118'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",286.0,BOOK,['Law'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=loRSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=loRSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=loRSEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CONVENTION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=loRSEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:CONVENTION&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Decisions_of_the_World_Court_Relevant_to.html?hl=&id=loRSEAAAQBAJ,,,A Reference Guide,,
The Night in Lisbon,['Erich Maria Remarque'],Random House,2014-02-04,"History and fate collide as the Nazis rise to power in The Night in Lisbon, a classic tale of survival from the renowned author of All Quiet on the Western Front. With the world slowly sliding into war, it is crucial that enemies of the Reich flee Europe at once. But so many routes are closed, and so much money is needed. Then one night in Lisbon, as a poor young refugee gazes hungrily at a boat bound for America, a stranger approaches him with two tickets and a story to tell. It is a harrowing tale of bravery and butchery, daring and death, in which the price of love is beyond measure and the legacy of evil is infinite. As the refugee listens spellbound to the desperate teller, in a matter of hours the two form a unique and unshakable bond—one that will last all their lives. “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will.

The Rector of Justin,['Louis Auchincloss'],HMH,2002-07-10,"“[A] certifiable masterpiece” from the acclaimed chronicler of New York City’s old money elite (The New York Observer). Widely considered Louis Auchincloss’s greatest novel, The Rector of Justin is an astute dissection of the social mores of the Northeast’s privileged establishment. The story centers on Rev. Frank Prescott, the charismatic founder and rector of a prestigious Episcopal school for boys. With laser-sharp insight, Auchincloss delivers a prismatic portrait of this commanding and complicated man through the eyes of those who knew—or thought they knew—him best. Seamlessly interweaving multiple points of view—from an adoring teacher to that of a rebellious daughter—The Rector of Justin presents a social history of the eighty years of his life: the sources of his virtues and failings, his successes, his love, and his crises of faith. As Jonathan Yardley put it in the Washington Post, “Auchincloss is one of the most accomplished and distinctive writers this country has known . . . [and] Frank Prescott is one of the great characters in American fiction.” “A daring and ambitious book . . . Its poise and taste and intelligence strike one on every page, as do its unerring knowledge and literary skill.” —The New Yorker “[The Rector of Justin] should sit on the shelf of any serious reader of American fiction.” —Jay Parini, The New York Observer “A taut and elegant study of a distinguished American whose closest friends cannot decide whether they like or detest him.” —The Times Literary Supplement “Fascinating . . . We do come to feel the reality, the complicated reality, of Francis Prescott.” —Saturday Review “My favorite of Auchincloss’s novels. Both decadent and demanding, high-hat and frank . . . A subversive in lace-up oxfords and rep tie.” —Amy Bloom","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780547524238'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0547524234'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",352.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.15.15.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8GeXWhe8Q6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8GeXWhe8Q6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8GeXWhe8Q6cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+RECTOR+OF+JUSTIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8GeXWhe8Q6cC&dq=intitle:THE+RECTOR+OF+JUSTIN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rector_of_Justin.html?hl=&id=8GeXWhe8Q6cC,,,A Novel,,

Man on the run,['Tom Doyle'],Tirion Algemeen,2014-03-26,"`Dit boek onthult wat Paul uit alle macht probeerde te verhullen, ook met zijn songs. The Scotsman Paul McCartney is in de jaren zeventig letterlijk a man on the run. Wanhopig probeert hij te ontsnappen aan zijn verleden als Beatle-icoon. De hippie-miljonair trekt zich met zijn nieuwe vrouw Linda terug op het Schotse platteland, op zoek naar een nieuwe identiteit en muziekstijl. Daarbij zoekt hij inspiratie in drugs en drank. Het zijn moeilijke jaren waarin Paul McCartney worstelt met een depressie door het uiteenvallen van The Beatles en diverse malen wordt vervolgd wegens drugsbezit. Toch maakt hij met zijn nieuwe band Wings verbluffend mooie platen en scoort grote hits waaronder `Mull of Kintyre . Voor dit boek sprak Tom Doyle uitvoerig met Paul McCartney zelf, waardoor hij in staat is een nieuw beeld te schetsen van deze turbulente periode, gekenmerkt door grote hoogte- en dieptepunten.

Source Criticism on the Schedule,"['Anna Rosenqvist', 'Stefan Ekecrantz']",Springer Nature,2022-10-17,"This textbook is a practical and theoretical teacher guide on how to develop critical thinking and source criticism in contemporary elementary and secondary education, which requires students to develop their critical thinking from different perspectives as well as to develop their ability to critically evaluate sources they use for school-related work. What can a teacher do to support such development? The authors discuss several different perspectives on how one, as a teacher, can think about and work with source criticism together with the students. In the first part of the book a theoretical background and a principled discussion of critical thinking are discussed. This includes psychological and philosophical perspectives on source criticism. In the second part there are concrete teaching examples and tips on how to work with source criticism in both primary and secondary school.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783031143366'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3031143361'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",111.0,BOOK,['Study Aids'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bfaVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bfaVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=bfaVEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=intitle:THE+SOURCE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bfaVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bfaVEAAAQBAJ,,,Teaching Critical Thinking,,
Ballad of the Green Beret,['Marc Leepson'],Rowman & Littlefield,2017-05-01,"The rough-and-tumble life of Special Forces vet and Sixties pop star Barry Sadler The top Billboard Hot 100 single of 1966 wasn’t “Paint It Black” or “Yellow Submarine”--it was “The Ballad of the Green Berets,” a hyper-patriotic tribute to the men of the Special Forces by Vietnam vet Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler. But Sadler’s clean-cut, all-American image hid a darker side, a Hunter Thompson-esque life of booze, girls, and guns. Unable to score another hit song, he wrote articles for Soldier of Fortune and pulp novels that made “Rambo look like a stroll through Disneyland.” He killed a lover’s ex-boyfriend in Tennessee. Settling in Central America, Sadler ran guns, allegedly trained guerrillas, provided medical care to residents, and caroused at his villa. In 1988 he was shot in the head by a robber on the streets of Guatemala and died a year later. This life-and-times biography of an American character recounts the sensational details of Sadler’s life vividly but soberly, setting his meteoric rise and tragic fall against the big picture of American society and culture during and after the Vietnam War.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780811765688'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0811765687'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",320.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1DIbDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1DIbDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1DIbDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+GREEN+BERETS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1DIbDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1DIbDgAAQBAJ,,,"The Life and Wars of Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler from the Vietnam War and Pop Stardom to Murder and an Unsolved, Violent Death",,

He is now the Tai-Pan—Supreme Leader—of all Tai-Pans in China. Along the way, however, he made a powerful enemy. Tyler Brock, Struan’s rival from their early opium-smuggling days, also heads a large trading fleet, second in size only to Struan’s. But it is not only silks and spices that drive their mutual companies’ wealth—the opium trade is still booming. War between England and China might be over, but the hostilities remain. Struan and Brock come to control much of England’s trade with China yet neither can control their desires or their hatred of each other. Over the years, their two families will cross paths, threatening to rip both apart, with reverberations that will echo across the generations. Struan must fight to save his company and his family, or risk seeing everything he has created destroyed at the hands of his sworn enemy. Ambition, political intrigue, and love and lust weave their way throughout the novel the New York Times called, “grand entertainment...packed with action...with blood and sin, treachery and conspiracy, sex and murder.” East and West come together in an opulent and intricately plotted narrative.

The Eighth Day,['Dianne K. Salerni'],Harper Collins,2014-04-22,"Fans of Percy Jackson will devour this first book in Dianne K. Salerni's time-bending series that combines exciting magic and pulse-pounding suspense. In this riveting fantasy adventure, thirteen-year-old Jax Aubrey discovers a secret eighth day with roots tracing back to Arthurian legend. When Jax wakes up to a world without any people in it, he assumes it's the zombie apocalypse. But when he runs into his eighteen-year-old guardian, Riley Pendare, he learns that he's really in the eighth day—an extra day sandwiched between Wednesday and Thursday. Some people—like Jax and Riley—are Transitioners, able to live in all eight days, while others, including Evangeline, the elusive teenage girl who's been hiding in the house next door, exist only on this special day. And there's a reason Evangeline's hiding.

Przed wami ogromny wybór drogiej biżuterii. Niepowtarzalna szansa obcowania z drogocennymi klejnotami. Najpierw jednak na waszej drodze stają sprzedawcy. Będą chcieli dobić targu i urobić was swoimi metodami. Ozłocić i ogołocić... To nie jest podrzędny sklep jubilerski, w którym twoja matka spienięża złote bransoletki. To jest Topaz. Tu wiedza złotnicza jest zbędna. Niepotrzebny jest też dyplom z zarządzania. Nieważne, co wiesz, ważne, ile sprzedajesz. To nie profesja, to metoda zarabiania pieniędzy. Nie interesuje mnie, kim jesteś, skąd przychodzisz ani jak sprzedajesz. Ja umieszczam towar w witrynie, rozkładam go przed klientem. Ty sprzedajesz… Jeśli sprzedasz, kupisz wszystko, co zechcesz. To proste. fragment książki Nowa powieść Hakana Gündaya przybliża świat, którym rządzi turystyka i w którym główną rolę zawsze odgrywają sprzedawcy. Kozan, główny bohater, potrafi sprzedać wszystko, co tylko wpadnie mu w ręce. Günday, przemawiając żargonem takich jak Kozan, ujawnia, że świat ten jest obliczony jedynie na sukces, którego miarą jest sprzedaż. Krytykując system i panujący ład, pisarz ukazuje nieznaną dotąd relację między Wschodem a Zachodem, dokonując bezkompromisowej krytyki społeczno-ekonomicznej turystyki w Turcji. Hakan Günday udowadnia, że zasługuje na uznanie i prestiżowe nagrody, które dotychczas zdobył, m.in.

True Grit tells the story of Mattie Ross, who is just fourteen when the coward Tom Chaney shoots her father down in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and robs him of his life, his horse, and $150 in cash. Mattie leaves home to avenge her father’s blood. With one-eyed Rooster Cogburn, the meanest available U.S. Marshal, by her side, Mattie pursues the killer into Indian Territory.

As Turner gets closer to the truth of Harting's disappearance, he will discover that the face of International relations - and the attentions of the British Ministry itself - is uglier that he could possibly have imagined.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780141967462'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0141967463'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",336.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.13.13.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ru53GoqldzMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ru53GoqldzMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ru53GoqldzMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+SMALL+TOWN+IN+GERMANY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ru53GoqldzMC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ru53GoqldzMC,,,,,
Portnoy's Complaint,['Philip Roth'],Vintage,2011-04-13,"The groundbreaking novel that propelled its author to literary stardom: told in a continuous monologue from patient to psychoanalyst, Philip Roth's masterpiece draws us into the turbulent mind of one lust-ridden young Jewish bachelor named Alexander Portnoy. Portnoy's Complaint n. [after Alexander Portnoy (1933- )] A disorder in which strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature. Spielvogel says: 'Acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus are plentiful; as a consequence of the patient's ""morality,"" however, neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification, but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration.' (Spielvogel, O. ""The Puzzled Penis,"" Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse, Vol. XXIV, p. 909.) It is believed by Spielvogel that many of the symptoms can be traced to the bonds obtaining in the mother-child relationship.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307744050'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307744051'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",289.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,3.8.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lbxLOs2AsH4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lbxLOs2AsH4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lbxLOs2AsH4C&dq=intitle:PORTNOY%27S+COMPLAINT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lbxLOs2AsH4C&dq=intitle:PORTNOY%27S+COMPLAINT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Portnoy_s_Complaint.html?hl=&id=lbxLOs2AsH4C,5.0,1.0,,,

Travels with My Aunt,['Graham Greene'],Open Road Media,2018-04-10,"A retired London bank manager is yanked out of the suburbs by his eccentric aunt for a “cheerfully irreverent” romp across Europe (The Guardian). Now that the dullish Henry Pulling has left his job with an agreeable pension and a firm handshake, he plans to spend more time weeding his dahlias. Then, for the first time in fifty years, he sees his aunt Augusta at his mother’s funeral. Charging into her seventies with florid abandon, not a day of her life wasted, and her future as bright as her brilliant red hair, Augusta insists that Henry abandon his garden, follow her, and hold on tight. With that, she whisks her nephew out of Brighton and boards the Orient Express bound for Paris and Istanbul, then on to Paraguay, and down the rabbit hole of her past that swarms with swindlers, smugglers, war criminals, and rather unconventional lovers. With each new stop, Henry discovers not only more about his aunt and her secrets but also about himself as well. Pulsing with “the tragic and comic ironies of love, loyalty and belief” Graham Greene’s deceptive lark of novel was made into the 1972 film starring Maggie Smith (The Times, London).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504052559'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504052552'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",282.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.12.12.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k-BUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k-BUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=k-BUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TRAVELS+WITH+MY+AUNT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k-BUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k-BUDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Great Lion of God,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2017-01-31,"New York Times Bestseller: A “beautifully written” and “truly outstanding” novel based on the life of Paul the Apostle (The Cincinnati Enquirer). Born a veritable great lion of God to a devout Jewish family, Saul of Tarsus is raised by his parents to embrace their love of humanity. Dogged by what he perceives as a lack of true faith, he embarks on a journey to save his people from sacrilege. But on the road to Damascus a vision of the resurrected Jesus changes the course of his life. Converting to Christianity, the newly christened Paul transforms from persecutor of blasphemers into apostle to the gentiles, becoming one of the supreme influences on the Catholic Church and the Western world. Great Lion of God paints a unique and very human portrait of Saint Paul, one of the most passionate, dauntless, and complex figures of early Christianity—Pharisee, lawyer, theologian, and above all, a “man like ourselves with our own despairs, doubts, anxieties and angers and intolerances, and ‘lusts of the flesh.’” The central novel in author Taylor Caldwell’s biblical trilogy, which also includes Dear and Glorious Physician and I, Judas, Great Lion of God is both “sheer entertainment” and a moving tribute to the majesty and power of the Christian faith (Fort Worth Star-Telegram).

"Rich Man, Poor Man",['Irwin Shaw'],Open Road Media,2013-02-26,"This New York Times–bestselling saga of two brothers in postwar America, the basis for the classic miniseries, is “a book you can’t put down” (The New York Times). Siblings Rudy, Tom, and Gretchen Jordache grow up in a small town on the Hudson River. They’re in their teens in the 1940s, too young to go to war but marked by it nevertheless. Their father is the local baker, and nothing suggests they will live storied lives. Yet, in this sprawling saga, each member of the family pushes against the grain of history and confronts the perils and pleasures of a world devastated by conflict and transformed by American commerce and culture. A memorable novel by one of America’s greatest twentieth-century authors, Rich Man, Poor Man offers a gripping ride through America between the Second World War and Vietnam. It was made into one of the first primetime TV mini-series, and starred Nick Nolte, Peter Strauss, and Susan Blakely. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Irwin Shaw including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author’s estate.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781480408142'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '148040814X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",632.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.28.26.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ZazAZNitw4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0ZazAZNitw4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0ZazAZNitw4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:RICH+MAN,+POOR+MAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ZazAZNitw4C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ZazAZNitw4C,5.0,1.0,A Novel,,

Everyone around her seems to be obsessed with the search for gold; an obsession so compulsive that it drives people from their homes to destitution, and even to death. Stirling Herrick wants it because his father did; and the Lynx himself seems determined to find it if only to exact some kind of revenge. Caught up in a violent world where life is held cheaply, Nora is both intoxicated by the gold rush climate and overwhelmed by the power of the mighty Lynx. Unable to desist, she becomes involved in his murderous schemes, returning to England, and to Whiteladies House.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780007235537'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0007235534'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",435.0,BOOK,['Australia'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x4lExzc96eAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x4lExzc96eAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4lExzc96eAC&dq=intitle:THE+SHADOW+OF+THE+LYNX&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4lExzc96eAC&dq=intitle:THE+SHADOW+OF+THE+LYNX&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Shadow_of_the_Lynx.html?hl=&id=x4lExzc96eAC,,,,,

Captains and the Kings,['Taylor Caldwell'],Open Road Media,2016-11-15,"New York Times Bestseller: Sweeping from the 1850s through the early 1920s, this towering family saga examines the price of ambition and power. Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh is twelve years old when he gets his first glimpse of the promised land of America through a dirty porthole in steerage on an Irish immigrant ship. His long voyage, dogged by tragedy, ends not in the great city of New York but in the bigoted, small town of Winfield, Pennsylvania, where his younger brother, Sean, and his infant sister, Regina, are sent to an orphanage. Joseph toils at whatever work will pay a living wage and plans for the day he can take his siblings away from St. Agnes’s Orphanage and make a home for them all. Joseph’s journey will catapult him to the highest echelons of power and grant him entry into the most elite political circles. Even as misfortune continues to follow the Armagh family like an ancient curse, Joseph takes his revenge against the uncaring world that once took everything from him. He orchestrates his eldest son Rory’s political ascent from the offspring of an Irish immigrant to US senator. And Joseph will settle for nothing less than the pinnacle of glory: seeing his boy crowned the first Catholic president of the United States. Spanning seventy years, Captains and the Kings, which was adapted into an eight-part television miniseries, is Taylor Caldwell’s masterpiece about nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America, and the grit, ambition, fortitude, and sheer hubris it takes for an immigrant to survive and thrive in a dynamic new land.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504039017'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504039017'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",750.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.37.31.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6c5SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6c5SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6c5SDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CAPTAINS+AND+THE+KINGS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6c5SDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6c5SDQAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The novel follows the outsize adventures of Billy Clyde Puckett, star halfback for the New York Giants, whose team has come to Los Angeles for an epic duel with the despised ""dog-ass"" Jets in the Super Bowl. But Billy Clyde is faced with a dual challenge: not only must he try to run over a bunch of malevolents incarnate, but he has also been commissioned by a New York book publisher to keep a journal of the events leading up to, including, and following the game. Infused with Dan Jenkins's characteristic joie de vivre and replete with cigarettes, whiskey, and wild women, Semi-Tough is an uproarious romp through a lost era of professional sports that will have any armchair quarterback falling out of his or her recliner in hysterics on a semi-regular basis.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780306824357'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0306824353'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",318.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=inVKDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=inVKDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=inVKDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SEMI-TOUGH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=inVKDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=inVKDgAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Green Darkness,['Anya Seton'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,1973-01-23,"A 1960s guru sends a troubled American woman back over 400 years into a past life to save her marriage in this classic New York Times–bestselling romance. Strange things are afoot after English aristocrat Richard Marsdon takes his new wife Celia, an American heiress, to his family home in Sussex. Richard acts out of character, and Celia is suffering a debilitating emotional breakdown. A friend of Celia’s mother, a wise, Hindu mystic, realizes the couple is haunted by an event from their past lives, and the only way to repair the damage is to send Celia back in time. She journeys back almost four hundred years to the reign of Edward VI and her former life as the servant girl Celia de Bohun—and her doomed love affair with the chaplain Stephen Marsdon. Although Celia and Stephen can’t escape the horrifying consequences of their love, fate—and time—offer them another chance for redemption.

A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,['James Joyce'],Penguin,2016-05-24,"""I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use -- silence, exile, and cunning."" James Joyce's supremely innovative fictional autobiography is also, in the apt phrase of the biographer Richard Ellmann, nothing less than ""the gestation of a soul."" For as he describes the shabby, cloying, and sometimes terrifying Dublin upbringing of his alter ego, Stephen Dedalus, Joyce immerses the reader in his emerging consciousness, employing language that ranges from baby talk to hellfire sermon to a triumphant artist's manifesto. The result is a novel of immense boldness, eloquence, and energy, a work that inaugurated a literary revolution and has become a model for the portrayal of the self in our time. The text of this edition has been newly edited by Hans Walter Gabler and Walter Hettche and is followed by a new afterword, chronology, and bibliography by Richard Brown.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101992241'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101992247'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",384.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1x53CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1x53CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1x53CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CENTENNIAL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1x53CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1x53CgAAQBAJ,,,Centennial Edition (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition),,

Shardik,['Richard Adams'],Simon and Schuster,2014-11-06,"This brilliantly inventive fantasy epic by the award-winning author of Watership Down immerses the reader in a medieval world complete with created languages, detailed maps and elaborate traditions and rituals. Centring on the long-awaited reincarnation of a giant bear among the half-barbaric Orelgan people, Shardik's appearance sets off a violent chain of events as faith in his divinity sweeps the land. Closest to the bear is the hunter Kelderek, a naturally pious, ignorant, well-meaning man who becomes - in his dedication to Shardik - a prophet, victorious soldier, corrupt priest-king and ruler of an empire. A gripping tale of war, adventure, morality and slavery, horror and romance, Shardik is a remarkable exploration of mankind's universal desire for divine incarnation, and the corrosive influence of power.

The Great Train Robbery,"['Nick Russell-Pavier', 'Stewart Richards']",Hachette UK,2013-01-10,"Definitive account of the famous 1963 Great Train Robbery - and its aftermath. In the early hours of Thursday 8th August 1963 at rural Cheddington in Buckinghamshire, £2.6 million (£50 million today) in unmarked £5, £1 and 10-shilling notes was stolen from the Glasgow to London nightmail train in a daring and brilliantly executed operation lasting just 46 minutes. Quickly dubbed the crime of the century, it has captured the imagination of the public and the world's media for 50 years, taking its place in British folklore and giving birth to the myths of The Great Train Robbery. Ronnie Biggs, Buster Edwards and Bruce Reynolds became household names. But what really happened? This is the story of four talented villains who took the criminal world by storm, of the 'perfect crime'. It is also the story of ruthless policemen, determined to hunt the robbers down and to make sure nobody slipped through the net, not even the innocent. It is the story of an Establishment under siege, and of one mistake which cost the robbers 307 years in prison. Fifty years later, here is the story set out in full for the first time, a true-life crime thriller, and also a vivid slice of British social history.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780297864400'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0297864408'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['True Crime'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6KSaWB4zMzMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6KSaWB4zMzMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6KSaWB4zMzMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+GREAT+TRAIN+ROBBERY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6KSaWB4zMzMC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6KSaWB4zMzMC,,,Crime of the Century: The Definitive Account,,

Ordering the World,"['Robert Hymes', 'Conrad Schirokauer']",University of California Press,2018-08-14,"The Sung Dynasty (960–1278) was a time of vast changes and new challenges in China. The growth of the urban and rural economics, population increase, the emergence of an educated elite, political and intellectual ferment, and threats from hostile neighbors are some of the forces that shaped the age. How did Sung statesmen and thinkers view the relation of state and society and the role of political action in solving society’s ills? The essays in Ordering the World explore contemporary ideas underlying policies, programs, and institutions of the period and examine attitudes toward history and sources of authority. Their findings have important implications for our understanding of the neo-Confucian movement in Sung history and of the Sung in the history of Chinese ideas about politics and social action.

The Silmarillion,['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],Mariner Books,2001,"A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT. Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing. The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy. This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0618126988'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780618126989'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",386.0,BOOK,['FICTION'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zlB71nO7T5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zlB71nO7T5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zlB71nO7T5EC&q=intitle:THE+SILMARILLION&dq=intitle:THE+SILMARILLION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=zlB71nO7T5EC&dq=intitle:THE+SILMARILLION&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Silmarillion.html?hl=&id=zlB71nO7T5EC,,,,,

The Holcroft Covenant,['Robert Ludlum'],Bantam,2012-08-14,"The Fourth Reich is waiting to arise—and the only man who can stop it is about to sign its birth certificate. In 1945 the children of the Third Reich were secretly hidden all over the world, to be concealed until they came of age in the 1970s, at which point $780 million would be waiting in a Swiss bank. But all of these elaborate plans need an unsuspecting outsider to set them in motion: Noel Holcroft, the American son of a high-ranking Nazi officer. He has just been shown an incredible document known as the Holcroft Covenant. If he signs, he will inadvertently deal a serious blow to an already fragile world—and authorize his own death warrant.

It is a passionate, triumphant story that excites us, fills us with joy, move us to tears, satisfies us deeply, and helps us remember just what it is we want most from a novel. M.M.

Het nieuwsdieet,['Rolf Dobelli'],Spectrum,2020-01-09,"Nieuws is voor onze hersenen als suiker voor ons lichaam Het dagelijkse nieuws leidt ons af van waar het nu echt om draait, het maakt ons depressief en het laat onze wilskracht verdwijnen. Nu is het moment gekomen om hierbij stil te staan en de juiste stappen te nemen. Een leven zonder een overload aan informatie. Nieuwsfeitjes geven geen representatief beeld van de wereld waarin we leven. Denk daarbij aan de volgende voorbeelden: • Terrorisme wordt overschat. Chronische stress is onderschat. • De val van Lehman Brothers wordt overschat. Fiscale verantwoordelijkheid is onderschat. • Vliegtuigrampen worden overschat. Immuniteit voor antibiotica is onderschat. Daarnaast heeft nieuws weinig tot geen invloed op ons leven en vereist het ook geen denkwerk. We zijn dan ook nooit verzadigd als het gaat om het opnemen van nieuws. In tegenstelling tot het lezen van boeken en achtergrondartikelen kunnen we nieuwsfeitjes onbeperkt tot ons nemen, zoals een zak drop.

Sophie's Choice,['William Styron'],Open Road Media,2010-05-04,"This award-winning novel of love, survival, and agonizing regret in post–WWII Brooklyn “belongs on that small shelf reserved for American masterpieces” (The Washington Post Book World). Winner of the National Book Award and a modern classic, Sophie’s Choice centers on three characters: Stingo, a sexually frustrated aspiring novelist; Nathan, his charismatic but violent Jewish neighbor; and Sophie, an Auschwitz survivor who is Nathan’s lover. Their entanglement in one another’s lives will build to a stirring revelation of agonizing secrets that will change them forever. Poetic in its execution, and epic in its emotional sweep, Sophie’s Choice explores the good and evil of humanity through Stingo’s burgeoning worldliness, Nathan’s volatile personality, and Sophie’s tragic past. Mixing elements from Styron’s own experience with themes of the Holocaust and the history of slavery in the American South, the novel is a profound and haunting human drama, representing Styron at the pinnacle of his literary brilliance.

The Executioner's Song,['Norman Mailer'],Hachette UK,2012-05-08,"Norman Mailer's Pulitzer Prize-winning and unforgettable classic about convicted killer Gary Gilmore now in a brand-new edition. Arguably the greatest book from America's most heroically ambitious writer, The Executioner's Song follows the short, blighted life of Gary Gilmore who became famous after he robbed two men in 1976 and killed them in cold blood. After being tried and convicted, he immediately insisted on being executed for his crime. To do so, he fought a system that seemed intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. And that fight for the right to die is what made him famous. Mailer tells not only Gilmore's story, but those of the men and women caught in the web of his life and drawn into his procession toward the firing squad. All with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscape and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest source of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement-impossible to put down, impossible to forget.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781455510832'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1455510831'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",1136.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.15.15.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WRE2AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WRE2AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WRE2AQAAQBAJ&pg=PT4&dq=intitle:THE+EXECUTIONER%27S+SONG&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WRE2AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WRE2AQAAQBAJ,,,,,
The Devil's Alternative,['Frederick Forsyth'],Penguin,2012-09-04,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Frederick Forsyth delivers a frighteningly possible novel of international terrorism and impending war… As the Russian people face starvation, the Politburo is faced with a hard choice: negotiate with America for food, go to war for national survival, or deal with an uprising in the motherland. Through an informant, British Agent Adam Munro learns that the situation is growing dangerously tense, with powerful forces in the USSR maneuvering for supremacy. But even as East and West conduct delicate talks, events spiral out of control and threaten to undo every step taken. The world’s largest oil tanker is hijacked by terrorists, and a Ukrainian “freedom fighter” is rescued in a bloody catastrophe on the Black Sea. From Moscow to Washington, the stakes grow ever more perilous as the mad actions of a few threaten to engulf the entire world in nuclear war—unless Munro can stop them.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101602164'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101602163'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",528.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOqtXGAJx6gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOqtXGAJx6gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MOqtXGAJx6gC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+DEVIL%27S+ALTERNATIVE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MOqtXGAJx6gC&dq=intitle:THE+DEVIL%27S+ALTERNATIVE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Devil_s_Alternative.html?hl=&id=MOqtXGAJx6gC,,,A Thriller,,

The Spike,['Mark Humphries'],Princeton University Press,2023-01-24,"The story of a neural impulse and what it reveals about how our brains work We see the last cookie in the box and think, can I take that? We reach a hand out. In the 2.1 seconds that this impulse travels through our brain, billions of neurons communicate with one another, sending blips of voltage through our sensory and motor regions. Neuroscientists call these blips “spikes.” Spikes enable us to do everything: talk, eat, run, see, plan, and decide. In The Spike, Mark Humphries takes readers on the epic journey of a spike through a single, brief reaction. In vivid language, Humphries tells the story of what happens in our brain, what we know about spikes, and what we still have left to understand about them. Drawing on decades of research in neuroscience, Humphries explores how spikes are born, how they are transmitted, and how they lead us to action. He dives into previously unanswered mysteries: Why are most neurons silent? What causes neurons to fire spikes spontaneously, without input from other neurons or the outside world? Why do most spikes fail to reach any destination? Humphries presents a new vision of the brain, one where fundamental computations are carried out by spontaneous spikes that predict what will happen in the world, helping us to perceive, decide, and react quickly enough for our survival. Traversing neuroscience’s expansive terrain, The Spike follows a single electrical response to illuminate how our extraordinary brains work.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780691241487'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0691241481'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",232.0,BOOK,['Psychology'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyR-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyR-EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jyR-EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&dq=intitle:THE+SPIKE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jyR-EAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+SPIKE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Spike.html?hl=&id=jyR-EAAAQBAJ,,,An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds,,

Singing in the brain,['Erik Scherder'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2017-04-21,"Erik Scherder speelt viool. Hij kan er nog niet veel van, maar het oefenen en het bezig zijn met muziek stimuleert zijn hersenen. Hij wordt er fit van – en gelukkig.

Een aantal bijzondere mensen komt voorbij: de violist die een aardbeving overleefde, het meisje dat uit een coma ontwaakt door haar lievelingsmuziek, de verlamde gitarist die componist werd, de eeneiige tweeling die geen melodie kan volgen maar ritmisch geniaal is. Waarom wordt een liedje een hit? Waarom houden we van droevige muziek? Dit boek beantwoordt alle vragen over hersenen en muziek. Boeiende wetenschap wordt afgewisseld met unieke casestudy’s. De meest bevlogen professor van Nederland vertelt zoals alleen hij dat kan: met vaart, vaardigheid en een groot inlevingsvermogen.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789025307042'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9025307043'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",,BOOK,['Medical'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.0.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2VK1DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2VK1DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2VK1DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BRAIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2VK1DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2VK1DgAAQBAJ,,,over de unieke samenwerking tussen muziek en de hersenen,,

Gorky Park,['Martin Cruz Smith'],Pocket Books,2020-01-28,"The “gripping, romantic, and dazzlingly original” (Cosmopolitan) Arkady Renko book that started it all: the #1 bestseller Gorky Park, an espionage classic that begins the series, by Martin Cruz Smith, “the master of the international thriller” (The New York Times). It begins with a triple murder in a Moscow amusement center: three corpses found frozen in the snow, faces and fingers missing. Chief homicide investigator Arkady Renko is brilliant, sensitive, honest, and cynical about everything except his profession. To identify the victims and uncover the truth, he must battle the KGB, FBI, and the New York City police as he pursues a rich, ruthless, and well-connected American fur dealer. Meanwhile, Renko is falling in love with a beautiful, headstrong dissident for whom he may risk everything. “Brilliant...there are enough enigmas within enigmas within enigmas to reel the mind” (The New Yorker) in this wonderfully textured, vivid look behind the Iron Curtain. “Once one gets going, one doesn’t want to stop...The action is gritty, the plot complicated, and the overriding quality is intelligence” (The Washington Post). The first in a classic series, Gorky Park “reminds you just how satisfying a smoothly turned thriller can be” (The New York Times Book Review).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982132149'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982132140'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",608.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W2PHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W2PHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=W2PHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:GORKY+PARK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=W2PHDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:GORKY+PARK&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Gorky_Park.html?hl=&id=W2PHDwAAQBAJ,,,,,
Kalevipoeg Studies,['Cornelius Hasselblatt'],BoD - Books on Demand,2018-03-13,"This is the first English-language monograph on the poem Kalevipoeg (1857-1861), composed by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803-1882). The poem is over 19,000 lines long, and is known today as the Estonian national epic. The epic was not a success story from the beginning, however. It took at least one generation before the text was received by the emerging Estonian intellectual class. In the meantime, immediately after the release of the bilingual Estonian-German edition, the text was received abroad more intensively than at home. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries it is the most prolific text within Estonian literature, leaving its traces everywhere in Estonian literature and everyday life.

Free Fall in Crimson,['John D. MacDonald'],Random House,2013-01-08,"From a beloved master of crime fiction, Free Fall in Crimson is one of many classic novels featuring Travis McGee, the hard-boiled detective who lives on a houseboat. He was rich, mean, and slowly succumbing to cancer—until someone hastened the inevitable by beating him to death at a Florida truck stop. Now Ellis Esterland’s son wants Travis McGee to find out who killed his estranged father. The why seems obvious: Esterland’s multimillion-dollar estate. “The Travis McGee novels are among the finest works of fiction ever penned by an American author.”—Jonathan Kellerman Though he had been reassured that he would receive a substantial inheritance, Ron Esterland was disowned by his wealthy father years ago. But upon dear old Dad’s conveniently timed murder, the family fortune winds up in the hands of Ellis’s ex-wife instead. The quest to recover Ron’s money takes McGee from Hollywood to the Midwest, where he confronts prostitution rings and drug deals gone wrong. In the haze of violence surrounding him, McGee starts to lose sight of who he really is. But one thing remains crystal clear: McGee is on the trail of a killer conjured from his worst nightmares.

Selling more than three million copies, it launched Andrew M. Greeley's career as one of America's most popular storytellers. Back in print at last, this powerful saga of ambition, temptation, and love both spiritual and carnal is as timely and provocative as ever. Lifelong friends and occasional rivals, Kevin Brennan and Patrick Donahue enter seminary together, but their lives soon diverge dramatically. Intellectual and independent, Kevin achieves success as a scholar but often finds himself at odds with his superiors in the Church. And his unwavering principles threaten to cut him off from those closest to him—including the former sweetheart he has never forgotten. By contrast, the ambitious Patrick rises steadily through the Church hierarchy, only to fall prey to the temptations of lust and power. As hidden scandals and Patrick's inner demons threaten to destroy the lives of everyone around him, it's up to his oldest friend to save him from himself—and foil a conspiracy that could change the very future of the Papacy!

The agent has spent 9 years fighting the spread of Communism in Europe, and he intends to continue the battle. It shouldn’t be hard for the Russians to convict him of espionage—after all, Oakes was found on Soviet soil in a downed U-2 spy plane—and it will take a masterstroke for the agent to escape execution. The funny thing is, the Russians are playing right into his hands. After 3 years on leave from the CIA, Oakes was brought back to take part in 1 of the most daring operations in intelligence history. His mission is to crash the plane, get captured, and endure the trial. So far, everything’s going according to plan. Now he just has to get out of the Soviet Union alive. Marco Polo, If You Can is the 4th book in the Blackford Oakes Mysteries, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504018524'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504018524'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",193.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.24.22.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5xIfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5xIfCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5xIfCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT89&dq=intitle:MARCO+POLO,+IF+YOU+CAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5xIfCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5xIfCgAAQBAJ,,,,,
North and South,['Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell'],,1855,"When her father leaves the Church in a crisis of conscience, Margaret Hale is uprooted from her comfortable home in Hampshire to move with her family to the north of England. Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fuses individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale creates one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.","[{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'BCUL:1092409947'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",440.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.5.0.full.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HeAUAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HeAUAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HeAUAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NORTH+AND+SOUTH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HeAUAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HeAUAAAAQAAJ,5.0,1.0,,,
The Dean's December,['Saul Bellow'],Odyssey Editions,2016-03-31,"After being widely portrayed as a virulent racist and a traitor to his city, Professor Albert Corde, dean of the faculty of Journalism, is forced to leave Chicago. Corde is ill-equipped to handle the outrage that faces him, both as the author of several articles on Chicago’s endemic corruption, and as an outspoken figure in the controversial trial of two black men charged with killing a white student. Travelling to Bucharest to visit his ailing mother-in-law, he is unable to escape the comparisons in his mind between the corrupt and dehumanizing aspects of the communist regime, and the abandoned streets of his home city. Meditating on the juxtaposition between two distant worlds, and obsessing over events that begin to unfold both in Chicago and Bucharest, he begins to concede defeat. In this tormented tale, amid the swirling forces that threaten to drown his humanity, Corde slides ever closer to the brink of desolation.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781623730345'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1623730341'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",309.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4rcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r4rcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=r4rcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8&dq=intitle:THE+DEAN%27S+DECEMBER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r4rcCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r4rcCwAAQBAJ,,,,,

But living in her own world has long been preferable to dealing with the disappointments of real life. So when Maybell inherits a charming house in the Smokies from her Great-Aunt Violet, she seizes the opportunity to make a fresh start. Yet when she arrives, it seems her troubles have only just begun. Not only is the house falling apart around her, but she isn't the only inheritor: she has to share everything with Wesley Koehler, the groundskeeper who's as grouchy as he is gorgeous--and it turns out he has a very different vision for the property's future. Convincing the taciturn Wesley to stop avoiding her and compromise is a task more formidable than the other dying wishes Great-Aunt Violet left behind. But when Maybell uncovers something unexpectedly sweet beneath Wesley's scowls, and as the two slowly begin to let their guard down, they might learn that sometimes the smallest steps outside one's comfort zone can lead to the greatest rewards.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780593085547'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '059308554X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gPyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4gPyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4gPyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TWICE+SHY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4gPyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4gPyDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Aquitaine Progression,['Robert Ludlum'],Bantam,2012-08-14,"“You won’t be able to put it down. (Don’t ever begin a Ludlum novel if you have to go to work the next day).”—Chicago Sun-Times In Geneva, American lawyer Joel Converse meets a man he hasn’t seen in twenty years, a covert operative who dies violently at his feet, whispering words that hand Converse a staggering legacy of death: “The generals . . . they’re back . . .

Pursued by anonymous executioners to the dark corners of Europe, he is forced to play a game of survival by blood rules he thought he’d long left behind.

Full Circle,['Richard Burgoyne'],BookRix,2021-06-03,"A murder, a rescue and the ultimate act of love: Full Circle chronicals the Taylor family's triumph over violence and chaos. Rural Virginia, 1958: ""For a Saturday night it was quiet, even for Slocum, a place Buddy thought no one in their right mind would choose to be."" Educated by years of domestic chaos, the Taylor children must adapt after their mother is shot by their father. Clarence, the new head of the family at twenty-two, steals a moving van and smuggles them from their rural Virginia home to a life in Baltimore, a monumental challenge for a Black family in the 1950s. Though society conspires against them, the Taylor children are not without allies: Leo and Anna Antanucci are the owners of the moving company where Clarence Taylor works. Leo and Anna, alone and banished from their own families, have struggled to start their business and family, when a moving van filled with five children is unexpectedly unloaded on their doorstep. Buddy, Cherise, Billy, Roy and Otis learn how to survive - and thrive - in a turbulent 1960s and 70s Baltimore, while Leo and Anna find the family they had been denied. The extended Taylor/Antanucci family makes their way through the many triumphs and tragedies thrown their way. Cherise, the Taylor family prodigy, finds professional success in adulthood, but ultimately realizes that her life is not complete. She takes a page from Leo and Anna and works to sponsor and bring a semi-orphaned family from Iraq to Baltimore, smuggling them over the border not in a moving truck but a mini-van. Full Circle explores issues of race and national identity, gender equality, and the ultimate triumph of love and gratitude in a hard world.

But when the illness worsens and she slips into a coma, Dr. Andrew Jordan is forced to tell Rowe’s husband that his wife is dying. It’s 1957 and there simply isn’t a drug that can save her. Pharmaceutical saleswoman Celia de Grey then offers Dr. Jordan a sample of an experimental drug that cures the dying woman overnight. This marks the beginning of an epic journey—and a great romance—for a dedicated internist and an idealistic, ambitious woman. The miracle cure establishes de Grey as a rising star within the industry. But as the years pass, she and her husband, Dr. Jordan, begin to realize that her bosses are driven not by the desire to eradicate disease, but by greed. Millions can be made in matters of life and death—for those who don’t mind getting blood on their hands.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504022200'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1504022203'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",452.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.14.15.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2PB3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2PB3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2PB3CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:STRONG+MEDICINE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2PB3CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2PB3CgAAQBAJ,,,,,

Twenty-one-year-old Lucy is frustrated with her constrained life in Hertfordshire, teaching and keeping house for her domineering father. But she is happy to be living next door to Tom and Jamie, two brothers she has known since childhood, and whom she loves equally. But her life is turned upside down when Tom decides he must travel to Spain to fight in the bloody Spanish Civil War. He is quickly followed by Jamie who, much to Lucy's despair, is supporting General Franco. To the dismay of her irascible father, Lucy decides that the only way to bring her boys back safely is to travel to Spain herself to persuade them to come home. Yet when she sees the horrific effects of the war, she quickly becomes immersed in the lifesaving work the Quakers are doing to help the civilian population, many of whom are refugees. As the war progresses and the situation becomes increasingly perilous, Lucy realises that the challenge going forward is not so much which brother she will end up with, but whether any of them will survive the carnage long enough to decide ... ____________ More praise for Acts of Love and War ...

The Sicilian Mafia,['Diego Gambetta'],Harvard University Press,1996-02,"Blood ceremonies, obscure symbols, elaborate codes, brutal executions: the arcane remnants of a defunct culture? The Mafia, this book suggests, is not nearly as bizarre as all that, not nearly as remote as we might think. In fact, as Diego Gambetta's analysis unfolds, the Mafia begins to resemble any other business. In a society where trust is in short supply, this business sells protection, a guarantee of safe conduct for commercial and social transactions. It grudgingly shares the market with other concerns like itself, of which it is merely the most successful. The author develops his elegant economic theory with ample evidence, much of it based on the remarkable work done by Judge Giovanni Falcone and his colleagues in Palermo and Agrigento in the 1980s. Drawing on the confessions of eight Mafiosi and the trials their revelations triggered, Gambetta is able to explain all manner of peculiar Mafia marketing strategies that have been endlessly misinterpreted in the past. He makes illuminating - and unexpected - comparisons between the business of protection and ordinary industries, such as automotive insurance, and advertising. And he teases out the subtle distinctions between protection and extortion, in which the protector himself poses a threat. This new approach reshapes traditional interpretations of the Mafia - its origins, functions, and social consequences. Applying informal economic analysis, Gambetta shows how such a recognized evil can perform a real service, and how such a recognizable service can inflict great harm on a society.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0674807421'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780674807426'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",350.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y3bv3tqWftYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y3bv3tqWftYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=y3bv3tqWftYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+SICILIAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=y3bv3tqWftYC&dq=intitle:THE+SICILIAN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Sicilian_Mafia.html?hl=&id=y3bv3tqWftYC,,,The Business of Private Protection,,

Inside/Outside,['R. B. J. Walker'],Cambridge University Press,1993,"In this book Rob Walker offers an original analysis of the relationship between twentieth-century theories of international relations, and the political theory of civil society since the early modern period. He views theories of international relations both as an ideological expression of the modern state, and as a clear indication of the difficulties of thinking about a world politics characterized by profound spatiotemporal accelerations. International relations theories should be seen, the author argues, more as aspects of contemporary world politics than as explanations of contemporary world politics. These theories are examined in the light of recent debates about modernity and post-modernity, sovereignty and political identity, and the limits of modern social and political theory. This book is a major contribution to the field of critical international relations, and will be of interest to social and political theorists and political scientists, as well as students and scholars of international relations.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0521421195'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780521421195'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",252.0,BOOK,['Political Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.4.3.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YIbhrT23ie8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YIbhrT23ie8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YIbhrT23ie8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:INSIDE,+OUTSIDE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.nl/books?id=YIbhrT23ie8C&dq=intitle:INSIDE,+OUTSIDE&hl=&source=gbs_api",https://books.google.com/books/about/Inside_Outside.html?hl=&id=YIbhrT23ie8C,,,International Relations as Political Theory,,

On a rainy November night, Dr. Simon Ellerbee stares out the window of his Upper East Side psychiatry office, miserably wishing he could seek counseling for the problems in his seemingly perfect life. He hears the door buzzer and goes to answer it, but flinches when he sees his unexpected guest. Minutes later, he’s dead, his skull crushed by repeated blows from a ball-peen hammer. Once the doctor was down, the killer turned over the body and smashed in Ellerbee’s eyes. With no leads and a case getting colder by the hour, the New York Police Department calls in former chief Edward Delaney. His search for the truth raises more questions than answers: Who had Ellerbee let into his office? Why were there two sets of wet footprints on the carpeting of the doctor’s townhouse? What caused Ellerbee’s odd personality transformation over the past year? And who murdered, then symbolically mutilated, the prominent Manhattan psychiatrist?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781453298398'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1453298398'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",456.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.28.28.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lXR1xOE7Fv4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lXR1xOE7Fv4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lXR1xOE7Fv4C&pg=PT304&dq=intitle:THE+FOURTH+DEADLY+SIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lXR1xOE7Fv4C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lXR1xOE7Fv4C,,,,,

It is these men, racing each other, who are orchestrating the search to find the perfect spy. Described by the author as his most autobiographical work, John le Carré's eleventh novel masterfully blends wit, compassion and unflagging tension with the poignant story of an estranged father and son.

Act of Will,['Barbara Taylor Bradford'],Macmillan Reference USA,1987,"""From beloved bestselling author Barbara Taylor Bradford comes the enthralling saga of three generations of extraordinary women--of the fate that befalls them, and the choices that define their lives... ""IN THE NAME OF LOVE. Orphaned after the death of her mother, well-bred Audra Kenton rose from selfless nurse to servant of an affluent suffragette, to a fiercely independent bride whose passionate marriage was overtaken by an unforeseeable tragedy. Now Audra has but one dream--to bestow upon her brilliantly artistic daughter, every opportunity that she was denied... AT THE HEART OF AMBITION. Given the world, the stubborn Christina has forsaken the wishes of her noble mother to forge the career of her choice--that of a glittering Manhattan fashion empire she hopes to bequeath to her own daughter. But in young and beautiful Kyle stirs a spirit that is inherently headstrong, equally independent, and just as ironically resistant to the sacrifices made in the name of love. FOR THE SAKE OF A DREAM. From the picturesque Yorkshire Dales to the ""haute couture"" luxuries of Paris and London to the bittersweet respite of home and family, three women face stunning betrayals and astonishing reversals of fate as each brings her own intimate struggle to their need of personal success and to a triumphant and heartening understanding of devotion, duty, and destiny.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0816142416'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780816142415'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",598.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.5.2.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V09Kz9wgq_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V09Kz9wgq_oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=V09Kz9wgq_oC&q=intitle:ACT+OF+WILL&dq=intitle:ACT+OF+WILL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=V09Kz9wgq_oC&dq=intitle:ACT+OF+WILL&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Act_of_Will.html?hl=&id=V09Kz9wgq_oC,,,,,
A Matter of Honor,['Jeffrey Archer'],St. Martin's Paperbacks,2004-12-28,"International bestseller Jeffrey Archer picks up the sweeping story of the Clifton Chronicles with A Matter of Honor--featuring a bonus interview with author. It seems innocent enough. A disgraced British colonel bequeaths a mysterious letter to his only son. But the moment Adam Scott opens the yellowing envelope, he sets into motion a deadly chain of events that threatens to shake the very foundations of the free world. Within days, Adam's lover is brutally murdered and he's running for his life through the great cities of Europe, pursued not only by the KGB, but by the CIA and his own countrymen as well. Their common intent is to kill him before the truth comes out. While powerful men in smoke-filled rooms plot ever more ingenious means of destroying him, Adam finds himself betrayed and abandoned even by those he holds most dear. When at last he comes to understand what he is in possession of, he's even more determined to protect it, for it's more than a matter of life and death-it's a matter of honor. Only days before Britain declares war on Germany, Harry Clifton, hoping to escape the consequences of long-buried family secrets, and forced to accept that his desire to marry Emma Barrington will never be fulfilled, has joined the Merchant Navy. But his ship is sunk in the Atlantic by a German U-boat, drowning almost the entire crew. An American cruise liner, the SS Kansas Star, rescues a handful of sailors, among them Harry and the third officer, an American named Tom Bradshaw. When Bradshaw dies in the night, Harry seizes on the chance to escape his tangled past and assumes his identity. On landing in America, however, Bradshaw quickly learns the mistake he has made, when he discovers what is awaiting him in New York. Without any way of proving his true identity, Harry Clifton is now chained to a past that could be far worse than the one he had hoped to escape.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429954020'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429954027'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",373.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.19.17.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-9U8U5CiSokC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-9U8U5CiSokC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-9U8U5CiSokC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+MATTER+OF+HONOR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-9U8U5CiSokC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-9U8U5CiSokC,3.5,21.0,,,
Wanderlust,['Rebecca Solnit'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2019-09-17,"Wandelen is waarschijnlijk de meest simpele en dagelijkse bezigheid die we kennen. In een wereld waar het steeds makkelijker is geworden om ons snel en zonder fysieke inspanning te verplaatsen, laat cultuurhistorica en bekroonde bestsellerauteur Rebecca Solnit ons zien hoe belangrijk het is om te lopen, nietig te zijn in een eindeloos landschap, te wandelen zonder te weten waarnaartoe, of te verdwalen in een stad. Solnit verbindt de evolutie van het menselijk lichaam – ons vermogen om rechtop te staan en ons voort te bewegen – met de belangrijkste wandelaars uit de geschiedenis en literatuur: van Kierkegaard, Thoreau en Gary Snyder tot Jane Austens romanpersonage Elizabeth Bennet. Wanderlust is een fascinerend, persoonlijk portret waarin Solnit de diepgaande, onlosmakelijke relatie tussen wandelen en denken blootlegt. ‘Solnit is briljant en de sociale kwesties waar ze over schrijft zijn zeer urgent.’ DE CORRESPONDENT Over Wanderlust : ‘Radicaal, menselijk, humoristisch, hartstochtelijk en belangrijk.’ ALAIN DE BOTTON ‘Een schrijver met verrassende frisheid en precisie.’ NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW ‘Ik loop van kust naar kust dus neem ik Rebecca Solnits diepgravende en fascinerende Wanderlust mee om me te laten inspireren.’ THE OBSERVER ‘Magistraal.’ THE GUARDIAN ‘Deze aangename en verhelderende geschiedenis van het wandelen ontvouwt zich als een gesprek met een bijzonder goed geïnformeerde en breed georiënteerde medewandelaar.’ PUBLISHERS WEEKLY ‘Het thema van Wanderlust mag gewoontjes lijken, wat zij ermee doet is ronduit fascinerend.’ L.A.

Post-Soviet Borders,"['Sabine von Löwis', 'Beate Eschment']",Taylor & Francis,2022-08-18,"This book investigates how borders in former Soviet Union territories have evolved and shifted in the thirty years since the end of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to fifteen independent states and numerous de facto states; but this process of rebordering is not finished, and social, economic, infrastructural, cultural and political networks and spaces continue to develop. This book explores the intersection between these geopolitical shifts and the individual lived experience, drawing on cases from across border regions in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Throughout, the book introduces and frames the case studies with well-informed theoretical, conceptual and methodological overviews that situate them within border studies in general and post-Soviet border spaces in particular. Overall, the book demonstrates that like a kaleidoscope, the dynamic elements in these newly evolved border regions are similar yet strikingly different in their juxtapositions, with the appearance of new configurations often dependent on changing geopolitical constellations. This timely guide to the post-Soviet world thirty years after the Cold War will be of interest to researchers across border studies, politics, geography, social anthropology, history, Eastern European Studies, Central Asian Studies, and Caucasian Studies.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781000642889'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1000642887'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",236.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.4.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Rh9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Rh9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3Rh9EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:KALEIDOSCOPE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Rh9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Rh9EAAAQBAJ,,,A Kaleidoscope of Shifting Lives and Lands,,

The Bonfire of the Vanities,['Tom Wolfe'],"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2002-02-21,"Vintage Tom Wolfe, The Bonfire of the Vanities, the #1 bestseller that will forever define late-twentieth-century New York style. ""No one has portrayed New York Society this accurately and devastatingly since Edith Wharton"" (The National Review) “A page-turner . . . Brilliant high comedy.” (The New Republic) Sherman McCoy, the central figure of Tom Wolfe's first novel, is a young investment banker with a fourteen-room apartment in Manhattan.

Rock Star,['David R. Shumway'],JHU Press,2014-09-15,"The nature and meaning of rock stardom—celebrities who embody the most important social and cultural conflicts of their era. ""All stars are celebrities, but not all celebrities are stars,"" states David Shumway in the introduction to Rock Star, an informal history of rock stardom. This deceptively simple statement belies the complex definition and meaning of stardom and more specifically of rock icons. Shumway looks at the careers and cultural legacies of seven rock stars in the context of popular music and culture—Elvis Presley, James Brown, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead, Joni Mitchell, and Bruce Springsteen. Granted, there are many more names that fall into the rock icon category and that might rightfully appear on this list. Partly, that is the point: ""rock star"" is a familiar and desired category but also a contested one. Shumway investigates the rock star as a particular kind of cultural construction, different from mere celebrity. After the golden age of moviemaking, media exposure allowed rock stars more political sway than Hollywood's studio stars, and rock stars gradually replaced movie stars as key cultural heroes. Because of changes in American society and the media industries, rock stars have become much more explicitly political figures than were the stars of Hollywood’s studio era. Rock stars, moreover, are icons of change, though not always progressive, whose public personas read like texts produced collaboratively by the performers themselves, their managers, and record companies. These stars thrive in a variety of media, including recorded music, concert performance, dress, staging, cover art, films, television, video, print, and others. Filled with memorable photographs, Rock Star will appeal to anyone interested in modern American popular culture or music history.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781421413938'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1421413930'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",265.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OkKXBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OkKXBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=OkKXBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ROCK+STAR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OkKXBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OkKXBAAAQBAJ,,,The Making of Musical Icons from Elvis to Springsteen,,

Not since Lonesome Dove has there been such a rich, exciting novel about the cowboys, Indians, and gunmen who live at the blazing heart of the American dream. “This tale of random violence, unlikely romance and quicksilver friendships in the old West is a rip-roaring gamble with a tear in its eye, and it pays off in spades.” —Publishers Weekly “Entertaining and peopled with . . . beguiling characters. McMurtry drills a bull’s eye, proving that he is among the most versatile of our writers.” —Library Journal “Storytelling at its best, the West at its fiercest, and McMurtry in his prime.” —The Seattle Times","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781451607741'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1451607741'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",420.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.8.10.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RF_6bIvhDZkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RF_6bIvhDZkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RF_6bIvhDZkC&pg=PA61&dq=intitle:ANYTHING+FOR+BILLY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RF_6bIvhDZkC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RF_6bIvhDZkC,5.0,1.0,A Novel,,

The Satanic Verses,['Salman Rushdie'],Viking,1989-02-22,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “[A] torrent of endlessly inventive prose, by turns comic and enraged, embracing life in all its contradictions. In this spectacular novel, verbal pyrotechnics barely outshine its psychological truths.”—Newsday Winner of the Whitbread Prize One of the most controversial and acclaimed novels ever written, The Satanic Verses is Salman Rushdie’s best-known and most galvanizing book. Set in a modern world filled with both mayhem and miracles, the story begins with a bang: the terrorist bombing of a London-bound jet in midflight. Two Indian actors of opposing sensibilities fall to earth, transformed into living symbols of what is angelic and evil. This is just the initial act in a magnificent odyssey that seamlessly merges the actual with the imagined. A book whose importance is eclipsed only by its quality, The Satanic Verses is a key work of our times. Praise for The Satanic Verses “Rushdie is a storyteller of prodigious powers, able to conjure up whole geographies, causalities, climates, creatures, customs, out of thin air.”—The New York Times Book Review “Exhilarating, populous, loquacious, sometimes hilarious, extraordinary . . . a roller-coaster ride over a vast landscape of the imagination.”—The Guardian (London) “A novel of metamorphoses, hauntings, memories, hallucinations, revelations, advertising jingles, and jokes.

Complexity,['Mitchell M. Waldrop'],Simon & Schuster,1993-09-01,"Why did the stock market crash more than 500 points on a single Monday in 1987? Why do ancient species often remain stable in the fossil record for millions of years and then suddenly disappear? In a world where nice guys often finish last, why do humans value trust and cooperation? At first glance these questions don't appear to have anything in common, but in fact every one of these statements refers to a complex system. The science of complexity studies how single elements, such as a species or a stock, spontaneously organize into complicated structures like ecosystems and economies; stars become galaxies, and snowflakes avalanches almost as if these systems were obeying a hidden yearning for order. Drawing from diverse fields, scientific luminaries such as Nobel Laureates Murray Gell-Mann and Kenneth Arrow are studying complexity at a think tank called The Santa Fe Institute. The revolutionary new discoveries researchers have made there could change the face of every science from biology to cosmology to economics. M. Mitchell Waldrop's groundbreaking bestseller takes readers into the hearts and minds of these scientists to tell the story behind this scientific revolution as it unfolds.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0671872346'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780671872342'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",364.0,BOOK,['Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,3.3.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=53Hlfg76sigC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=53Hlfg76sigC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=53Hlfg76sigC&q=intitle:THE+EDGE&dq=intitle:THE+EDGE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=53Hlfg76sigC&dq=intitle:THE+EDGE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Complexity.html?hl=&id=53Hlfg76sigC,4.5,7.0,The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos,,

Perfect for fans of Stephen King and Harlan Coben. 'This is white-knuckle, hair-curling-on-the-back-of-the-neck reading - as close to actual physical terror as the printed word can deliver' - Los Angeles Times Frank Pollard awakens in an alley, knowing nothing but his name and that he is in danger. Over the next few days he develops a fear of sleep because when he wakes he finds blood on his hands, and bizarre and terrifying objects in his pockets. Distraught and desperate, Frank begs husband-and-wife detective team Bobby and Julie Dakota to get to the bottom of his mysterious, amnesiac fugues. It seems a simple job, but they are drawn into ever-darkening realms where they encounter the nightmarish, hate-filled figure stalking Frank. And their lives are threatened, as is that of Julie's gentle, Down's-syndrome brother, Thomas. To Thomas, death is the 'bad place' from which there is no return. But as each of them ultimately learns, there are equally bad places in the world of the living, places so steeped in evil that, in contrast, death seems almost to be a relief...

Now David Webb, professor of Oriental studies, husband, and father, must do what he hoped never to do again—assume the terrible identity of Jason Bourne.

A patient escapes from a biological testing facility, unknowingly carrying a deadly weapon: a mutated strain of super-flu that will wipe out 99 percent of the world’s population within a few weeks. Those who remain are scared, bewildered, and in need of a leader.

The tenth novel in Tony Hillerman's acclaimed Leaphorn and Chee series — “Bolt the door, disconnect the phone, and declare yourself off limits....Coyote Waits is a real confounder, not at all what you expected.” (Denver Post) The car fire didn't kill Navajo Tribal Policeman Delbert Nez—a bullet did. And the old man in possession of the murder weapon is a whiskey-soaked shaman named Ashie Pinto. Officer Jim Chee is devastated by the slaying of his good friend Del, and confounded by the prime suspect's refusal to utter a single word of confession or denial. Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn believes there is much more to this outrage than what appears on the surface, as he and Jim Chee set out to unravel a complex weave of greed and death that involves a historical find and a lost fortune. But the hungry and mythical trickster Coyote is waiting, as always, in the shadows to add a strange and deadly new twist.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061801204'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061801208'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",356.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.6.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PeE-EKXlgFsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PeE-EKXlgFsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=PeE-EKXlgFsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:COYOTE+WAITS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PeE-EKXlgFsC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PeE-EKXlgFsC,,,,,

The Plains of Passage (with Bonus Content),['Jean M. Auel'],Bantam,2010-10-06,"Ayla, the heroine first introduced in The Clan of the Cave Bear, is known and loved by millions of readers. Now, in The Plains of Passage, Ayla’s story continues. Ayla and Jondalar set out on horseback across the windswept grasslands of Ice Age Europe. To the hunter-gatherers of their world--who have never seen tame animals--Ayla and Jondalar appear enigmatic and frightening. The mystery surrounding the woman, who speaks with a strange accent and talks to animals with their own sounds, is heightened by her uncanny control of a large, powerful wolf. The tall, yellow-haired man who rides by her side is also held in awe, not only for the magnificent stallion he commands, but also for his skill as a crafter of stone tools, and for the new weapon he devises, the spear-thrower. In the course of their cross-continental odyssey, Ayla and Jondalar encounter both savage enemies and brave friends. Together they learn that the vast and unknown world can be difficult and treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful and enlightening as well. All the pain and pleasure bring them closer to their ultimate destination, for the orphaned Ayla and the wandering Jondalar must reach that place on earth they can call home. As sweeping and spectacular as the land she creates, Jean M. Auel’s The Plains of Passage is an astonishing novel of discovery, danger, and love, a triumph for one of the world’s most original and popular authors.

The Dragon and the Dazzle,"['Marco Pellitteri', 'Jean-Marie Bouissou', 'Gianluca Di Fratta', 'Cristiano Martorella', 'Bounthavy Suvilay']",Tunué,2010,"""In the worldwide circulation of the products of cultural industries, an important role is played by Japanese popular culture in European contexts. Marco Pellitteri shows that the contact between Japanese pop culture and European youth publics occurred during two phases. By use of metaphor, the author calls them the Dragon and the Dazzle. The first took place between 1975 and 1995, the second from 1996 to today. They can be distinguished by the modalities of circulation and consumption/re-elaboration of Japanese themes and products in the most receptive countries: Italy, France, Spain, Germany and, across the ocean, the United States. During these two phases, several themes have been perceived, in Europe, as rising from Japan's social and mediatic systems. Among them, this book examines the most apparent from a European point of view: the author names them machine, infant, and mutation, visible mostly through manga, anime, videogames, and toys. Together with France, Italy is the European country that in this respect has had the most central role. There, Japanese imagination has been acknowledged not only by young people, but also by politicians, television programmers, the general public, educators, comics and cartoons authors. The growing influence of Japanese pop culture, connected to the appreciation of its manga, anime, toys, and videogames, also urges political and mediologic questions linked to the identity/ies of Japan as they are understood--wrongly or rightly--in Europe and the West, and to the increasingly important role of Japan in international relations.""--Back cover","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9788889613894'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '8889613890'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",734.0,BOOK,['Performing Arts'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FxUZHy9MXgoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FxUZHy9MXgoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FxUZHy9MXgoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DAZZLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FxUZHy9MXgoC&dq=intitle:DAZZLE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Dragon_and_the_Dazzle.html?hl=&id=FxUZHy9MXgoC,,,"Models, Strategies, and Identities of Japanese Imagination : a European Perspective",,

"The Firm, the Market, and the Law",['R. H. Coase'],University of Chicago Press,2012-06-15,"Few other economists have been read and cited as often as R.H. Coase has been, even though, as he admits, ""most economists have a different way of looking at economic problems and do not share my conception of the nature of our subject."" Coase's particular interest has been that part of economic theory that deals with firms, industries, and markets—what is known as price theory or microeconomics. He has always urged his fellow economists to examine the foundations on which their theory exists, and this volume collects some of his classic articles probing those very foundations. ""The Nature of the Firm"" (1937) introduced the then-revolutionary concept of transaction costs into economic theory. ""The Problem of Social Cost"" (1960) further developed this concept, emphasizing the effect of the law on the working of the economic system. The remaining papers and new introductory essay clarify and extend Coarse's arguments and address his critics. ""These essays bear rereading. Coase's careful attention to actual institutions not only offers deep insight into economics but also provides the best argument for Coase's methodological position. The clarity of the exposition and the elegance of the style also make them a pleasure to read and a model worthy of emulation.""—Lewis A. Kornhauser, Journal of Economic Literature Ronald H.

To truly see the dynamics of this love, we must take a close look at Jesus's relationships while he was here on earth.

No Greater Love is a study of Jesus's interactions with people throughout the book of John, including Nicodemus, the woman at the well, and even the Pharisees. What did this love look like in action, especially with those who are hard to love? As it turns out, he didn't love people because they deserved it; he loved them because he is love. With the great tragedies in our culture today there is a need for this ""Jesus love"" that's available to all believers.

On her advice, Wren and her Rover companion, Garth, journey to the coast of the Blue Divide, where they build a fire and let it burn for three days. With the unexpected help that their blaze attracts, they reach the isle of Morrowindle and near their goal - to find the last of the Elves. But they also find dangers such as they could not have imagined, and Wren will make a discovery that will change her life forever.

All through the Town,['Antero Garcia'],U of Minnesota Press,2023-02-28,"The role of the humble school bus in transforming education in America Everyone knows the yellow school bus. It’s been invisible and also omnipresent for a century. Antero Garcia shows how the U.S. school bus, its form unaltered for decades, is the most substantial piece of educational technology to ever shape how schools operate. As it noisily moves young people across the country every day, the bus offers the opportunity for a necessary reexamination of what “counts” as educational technology. Particularly in light of these buses being idled in pandemic times, All through the Town questions what we take for granted and what we overlook in public schooling in America, pushing for liberatory approaches to education that extend beyond notions of school equity. Forerunners: Ideas First is a thought-in-process series of breakthrough digital publications. Written between fresh ideas and finished books, Forerunners draws on scholarly work initiated in notable blogs, social media, conference plenaries, journal articles, and the synergy of academic exchange. This is gray literature publishing: where intense thinking, change, and speculation take place in scholarship.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781452969633'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1452969639'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",95.0,BOOK,['Education'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KTqUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KTqUEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KTqUEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT29&dq=intitle:ALL+AROUND+THE+TOWN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KTqUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KTqUEAAAQBAJ,,,The School Bus as Educational Technology,,

Now Jessie is utterly trapped in an isolated lakeside house that has become her prison—and comes face-to-face with her deepest, darkest fears and memories.

"""J"" is for Judgment",['Sue Grafton'],Holt Paperbacks,1993-05-15,"The next in the Kinsey Millhone Alphabet mystery series from bestselling author Sue Grafton. ""J"" is for Jaffe: Wendell Jaffe, dead these past five years. Or so it seemed until his former insurance agent spotted him in the bar of a dusty little resort halfway between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz. ""In truth, the facts about Wendell Jaffe had nothing to do with my family history, but murder is seldom tidy and no one ever said revelations operate in a straight line. It was my investigation into the dead man's past that triggered the inquiry into my own, and in the end the two stories became difficult to separate."" Five years ago, when Jaffe's thirty-five-foot Fuji ketch was found drifting off the Baja coast, it seemed a sure thing he'd gone overboard. The note he left behind admitted he was flat broke, his business bankrupt, his real estate gambit nothing but a huge Ponzi scheme about to collapse, with criminal indictment certain to follow. When the authorities soon after descended on his banks and his books, there was nothing left: Jaffe had stripped the lot. ""Given my insatiable curiosity and my natural inclination to poke my nose in where it doesn't belong, it was odd to realize how little attention I'd paid to my own past. I'd simply accepted what I was told, constructing my personal mythology on the flimsiest of facts."" But Jaffe wasn't quite without assets. There was the $500,000 life insurance policy made out to his wife and underwritten by California Fidelity. With no corpse to prove death, however, the insurance company was in no hurry to pay the claim. Dana Jaffe had to wait out the statutory five years until her missing husband could be declared legally dead. Just two months before Wendell Jaffe was sighted in that dusty resort bar, California Fidelity finally paid in full. Now they wanted the truth. And they were willing to hire Kinsey Millhone to dig it up. As Kinsey pushes deeper into the mystery surrounding Wendell Jaffe's pseudocide, she explores her own past, discovering that in family matters as in crime, sometimes it's better to reserve judgment. ""J"" is for judgment: the kind we're quick to make and often quicker to regret.

The Scorpio Illusion,['Robert Ludlum'],Bantam,2012-08-14,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Don’t ever begin a Ludlum novel if you have to go to work the next day.”—Chicago Sun-Times Tyrell Hawthorne was a naval intelligence officer—one of the best—until the rain-swept night in Amsterdam when his wife was murdered, an innocent victim of the games spies play. Now he’s called out of retirement for one last assignment. For Hawthorne is the only man alive who can track down the world’s most dangerous terrorist. Amaya Bajaratt is beautiful, elusive, and deadly—and she has set in motion a chilling conspiracy that a desperate government cannot stop. With his life and the life of the president hanging in the balance, Hawthorne must follow Bajaratt’s serpentine trail, a path of seduction, betrayal, and the looming threat of death. Racing from a millionaire recluse’s fortress to the social whirl of Palm Beach, from the Oval Office to treacherous Caribbean waters, Hawthorne will uncover a sinister network of well-placed men and women who exist to help this consummate killer—and the shattering truth behind the Scorpio Illusion.

"""K"" is for Killer",['Sue Grafton'],Holt Paperbacks,2009-11-03,"Lorna Kepler was beautiful and willful, a loner who couldn't resist flirting with danger. Maybe that's what killed her. Her death had raised a host of tough questions. The cops suspected homicide, but they could find neither motive nor suspect. Even the means were mysterious: Lorna's body was so badly decomposed when it was discovered that they couldn't be certain she hadn't died of natural causes. In the way of overworked cops everywhere, the case was gradually shifted to the back burner and became another unsolved file. Only Lorna's mother kept it alive, consumed by the certainty that somebody out there had gotten away with murder. In the ten months since her daughter's death, Janice Kepler had joined a support group, trying to come to terms with her loss and her anger. It wasn't helping. And so, leaving a session one evening and noticing a light on in the offices of Millhone Investigations, she knocked on the door. In answering that knock, Kinsey Millhone is pulled into the netherworld of unavenged murder, where only a pact with the devil will satisfy the restless ghosts of the victims and give release to the living they have left behind. Eleven books into the series that has won her readers around the world, Sue Grafton takes a darkside turn, pitching us into a shadow land of pain and grief where killers still walk free, unaccused, unpunished, unrepentant.

A FRIEND MADE ME REMEMBER,['Paul Bennett aka Cralion'],Xlibris Corporation,2009-09-23,"Paul’s writing spirit was revived in 1993 and he was re-inspired by a friend named Kim to renew his poetic writing and thus A FRIEND MADE ME REMEMBER WAS BORN to be followed by another book entitled FOR THE LOVE AND LOVER IN YOU. Three poems from that book are found in the highly acclaimed book THE CHOCOLATE SHIP by celebrated author Marissa Monteilh who also wrote MAY DECEMBER SOULS, HOT BOYZ, MAKE ME HOT AND MORE. Ms. Monteilh also wrote, “Paul Bennett is poetically talented beyond his years. A FRIEND MADE ME REMEMBER will lyrically touch each of your senses, and passionately stroke your soul. You will be moved, you will be touched, and your heart will be warmed by the flow of his genius.” Debra Clayton, celebrated author of RAP SUPERSTAR wrote, “blessed and truly talented. Although I find all of your poems to be intoxicating and mesmerizing, there were a few that climbed into my heart. God has blessed you with an incredible gift. Let the rest of the world experience what I experienced when I read your touching, thought provoking words.” Bennett’s writing spawned an anthology of poems contained within and reflects not only his gifted penchant for writing poetry, but reveals something about the man, his strong feelings for family, people and the world in which we live.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781462836826'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1462836828'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",172.0,BOOK,['Poetry'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CQGFEkXS5qEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CQGFEkXS5qEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CQGFEkXS5qEC&pg=PA99&dq=intitle:REMEMBER+ME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQGFEkXS5qEC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CQGFEkXS5qEC,,,"Poems from the Heart, the Mind, the Soul, and Spirit of",,

The Crossing,['Cormac McCarthy'],Vintage,2010-08-11,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The second volume of the award-winning Border Trilogy—From the bestselling author of The Passenger and the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Road—fulfills the promise of All the Pretty Horses and at the same time give us a work that is darker and more visionary, a novel with the unstoppable momentum of a classic western and the elegaic power of a lost American myth. In the late 1930s, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham captures a she-wolf that has been marauding his family's ranch. But instead of killing it, he decides to take it back to the mountains of Mexico. With that crossing, he begins an arduous and often dreamlike journey into a country where men meet ghosts and violence strikes as suddenly as heat-lightning—a world where there is no order ""save that which death has put there."" An essential novel by any measure, The Crossing is luminous and appalling, a book that touches, stops, and starts the heart and mind at once.

The Gift Economy,['David Cheal'],Routledge,2015-07-03,"Until recently we have known more about gift giving practices in pre-industrial societies than about those of industrial western society. In this book, first published in 1988, David Cheal shows that the process of present giving and receiving is a vital element in contemporary social life, relevant to some of the most important theoretical traditions in sociology, particularly those of Durkheim and Weber, and to the social constructionism of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. This volume is the result of a major study of gift rituals carried out by David Cheal and his associates in which general themes are richly illustrated with details from individual case histories gathered during the research. It is highly significant that in western society women are more active gift givers than men and, while their voices explain how emotions and interests are interrelated within the gift economy, the author shows how that in turn is related to current theories about family, gender and religion.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781317401339'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1317401336'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",243.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vPgWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vPgWCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vPgWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=intitle:THE+GIFT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vPgWCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vPgWCgAAQBAJ,,,,,
Debt of Honor,['Tom Clancy'],Hachette UK,2023-09-21,"'A crackling good read' -- Washington Post Razio Yamata is one of Japan's most influential industrialists. He has devised a plan to cripple American superiority and elevate Japan to a position of dominance on the world stage. His motivation is to pay off a debt of honour to his parents and bring low the country he feels was responsible for their deaths - America. All he needs is a catalyst to set his plan in motion. When the faulty gas tank on one Tennessee family's car leads to their fiery death, an opportunistic US congressman uses the occasion to rush a new trade law through the system. The law is designed to squeeze Japan economically. Instead, it provides Yamata with the leverage he needs. As Yamata's plan begins to unfold, it becomes clear to the world that someone is launching a fully integrated operation against the United States. There's only one man to find out who the culprit is - Jack Ryan, the new President's National Security Advisor.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781408727959'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1408727951'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",991.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9IeIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9IeIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9IeIEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DEBT+OF+HONOR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9IeIEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9IeIEAAAQBAJ,,,,,
The Body Farm,['Patricia Cornwell'],Simon and Schuster,2010-11-30,"#1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell returns to the chilling world of gutsy medical examiner Kay Scarpetta in this classic forensic thriller. Little Emily Steiner left a church meeting late one afternoon and strolled toward home along a lakeside path; a week later, her nude body was discovered, bound in blaze-orange duct tape. Called by the North Carolina authorities, forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta recognizes similarities to the gruesome work of a serial killer who has long eluded the FBI But as she tries to make sense of the evidence, she is left with questions that lead her to the Body Farm, a little known research facility in Tennessee where, with the help of some grisly experiments, she might discover the answer. It is Scarpetta alone who can interpret the forensic hieroglyphics that eventually reveal a solution to the case as staggering as it is horrifying. But she must also endeavor to help her niece, Lucy, who is embroiled in controversy at Quantico. And Scarpetta, too, is vulnerable, as she opens herself to the first physical and emotional bond she has felt in far too long a time. Tenacious and brilliant, tender and gentle, this is Scarpetta even more realized and poignant than we’ve seen her before—in a stunning achievement from a bestselling author at the peak of her powers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781451628906'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1451628900'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",358.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.10.11.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hb41TXoyfi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hb41TXoyfi8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hb41TXoyfi8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+BODY+FARM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hb41TXoyfi8C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hb41TXoyfi8C,,,Scarpetta 5,,

The Game of Our Lives,['David Goldblatt'],Penguin UK,2014-10-30,"WINNER of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award 2015 In the last two decades football in Britain has made the transition from a peripheral dying sport to the very centre of our popular culture, from an economic basket-case to a booming entertainment industry. What does it mean when football becomes so central to our private and political lives? Has it enriched us or impoverished us? In this sparkling book David Goldblatt argues that no social phenomenon tracks the momentous economic, social and political changes of the post-Thatcherite era in a more illuminating manner than football, and no cultural practice sheds more light on the aspirations and attitudes of our long boom and now calamitous bust. A must-read for the thinking football fan, The Game of Our Lives will appeal to readers of Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby and Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It will also be relished by readers of British social history such as Austerity Britain by David Kynaston. 'Brilliantly incisive. Goldblatt is not merely the best football historian writing today, he is possibly the best there has ever been.

Ladder of Years,['Anne Tyler'],Vintage,1996-03-26,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the beloved Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Breathing Lessons ""BALTIMORE WOMAN DISAPPEARS DURING FAMILY VACATION."" The headlines are all the same: Beloved mother and wife Delia Grinstead was last seen strolling down the Delaware shore, wearing only a bathing suit and carrying a beach tote with five hundred dollars tucked inside. To the best of her family's knowledge, she has disappeared without a trace. But Delia didn't disappear. She ran. Exhausted with her routine and everyone else's plans for her, Delia needed an out, a chance to make a new life for herself and to become a different person. The new Delia can let go of all the hurt and resentment that left her stuck in her past. As she eagerly sheds the pieces of herself she no longer needs, Delia discovers feelings of passion and wonder she'd long since forgotten. The thrill of walking away from it all leads to a newfound sense of self and the feeling that she is, finally, the star of her own life story.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780449910573'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0449910571'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",0.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oF2TEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oF2TEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oF2TEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:LADDER+OF+YEARS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oF2TEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:LADDER+OF+YEARS&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Ladder_of_Years.html?hl=&id=oF2TEAAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Drew Latham, Special Officer for Consular Operations in Paris, is frantic to discover his older brother’s fate.

Rose Madder,['Stephen King'],Simon and Schuster,2016-01-01,"The #1 national bestseller about a woman who escapes an abusive marriage is “one of Stephen King’s most engrossing horror novels. Relentlessly paced and brilliantly orchestrated...fueled by an air of danger immediate and overwhelming” (Publishers Weekly). Rosie Daniels leaves her husband, Norman, after fourteen years in an abusive marriage. She is determined to lose herself in a place where he won’t find her. She’ll worry about all the rest later. Alone in a strange city, she begins to make a new life, and good things finally start to happen. Meeting Bill is one; and getting an apartment is another. Still, it’s hard for Rosie not to keep looking over her shoulder, and with good reason. Norman is a cop, with the instincts of a predator. He’s very good at finding people, even if he is losing his mind. Fixed on revenge, Norman Daniels becomes a force of relentless terror and savageness, a man almost mythic in his monstrosity. For Rosie to survive, she must enter her own myth and become a woman she never knew she could be: Rose Madder. “Riveting, engrossing...packed with suspense” (People), Stephen King infuses this novel with an edge-of-your-seat, chilling atmosphere. Rose Madder is “an eerie, remarkably mature and moving novel” (The Washington Post).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501141287'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501141287'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",656.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],MATURE,True,1.25.23.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=17YACwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=17YACwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=17YACwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ROSE+MADDER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=17YACwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=17YACwAAQBAJ,,,,,
"Amy Beach, Passionate Victorian",['Adrienne Fried Block'],Oxford University Press,1998-12-17,"Amy Marcy Cheney Beach (1867-1944), the most widely performed composer of her generation, was the first American woman to succeed as a creator of large-scale art music. Her ""Gaelic"" Symphony, given its premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first work of its kind by an American woman to be performed by an American orchestra. Almost all of her more than 300 works were published soon after they were composed and performed, and today her music is finding new advocates and audiences for its energy, intensity, and sheer beauty. Yet, until now, no full-length critical biography of Beach's life or comprehensive critical overview of her music existed. This biography admirably fills that gap, fully examining the connections between Beach's life and work in light of social currents and dominant ideologies. Born into a musical family in Victorian times, Amy Beach started composing as a child of four and was equally gifted as a pianist. Her talent was recognized early by Boston's leading musicians, who gave her unqualified support. Although Beach believed that the life of a professional musician was the only life for her, her parents had raised her for marriage and a career of amateur music-making. Her response to this parental (and later spousal) opposition was to find creative ways of reaching her goal without direct confrontation. Discouraged from a full-scale concert career, she instead found her métier in composition. Success as a composer of art songs came early for Beach: indeed, her songs outsold those of her contemporaries. Nevertheless, she was determined to separate her work from the genteel parlor music women were writing in her day by creating large-scale works--a Mass, a symphony, and chamber music--that challenged the accepted notion that women were incapable of creating high art. She won the respect of colleagues and the allegiance of audiences. Many who praised her work, however, considered her an exception among women. Beach's reaction to this was to join with other women composers of serious music by promoting their works along with her own. Adrienne Fried Block has written a biography that takes full account of issues of gender and musical modernism, considering Beach in the contexts of her time and of her composer contemporaries, both male and female. Amy Beach, Passionate Victorian will be of great interest to students and scholars of American music, and to music lovers in general.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780195360783'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0195360788'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",448.0,BOOK,['Music'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.5.2.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o6HI1noueC4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o6HI1noueC4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=o6HI1noueC4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BEACH+MUSIC&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o6HI1noueC4C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o6HI1noueC4C,,,"The Life and Work of an American Composer, 1867-1944",,

From Potter's Field,['Patricia Cornwell'],Hachette UK,2008-09-04,"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

The Hundred Secret Senses,['Amy Tan'],Penguin,1995-10-17,"The Hundred Secret Senses is an exultant novel about China and America, love and loyalty, the identities we invent and the true selves we discover along the way. Olivia Laguni is half-Chinese, but typically American in her uneasiness with her patchwork family. And no one in Olivia's family is more embarrassing to her than her half-sister, Kwan Li. For Kwan speaks mangled English, is cheerfully deaf to Olivia's sarcasm, and sees the dead with her ""yin eyes."" Even as Olivia details the particulars of her decades-long grudge against her sister (who, among other things, is a source of infuriatingly good advice), Kwan Li is telling her own story, one that sweeps us into the splendor, squalor, and violence of Manchu China. And out of the friction between her narrators, Amy Tan creates a work that illuminates both the present and the past sweetly, sadly, hilariously, with searing and vivid prose.

Olivia Thatcher is the wife of a famous senator. She has given to her husband's ambitions and career until her soul is bone-dry. She is trapped in a web of duty and obligation, married to a man she once loved and no longer even knows; when her son died, a piece of Olivia died too. On the night of a bomb threat, Olivia and Peter meet accidentally in Paris. Their lives converge for one magical moment in the Place Vendôme, and in a café in Montmartre their hearts are laid bare. Peter, once so sure of his marriage and success, is faced with his professional career in jeopardy - Olivia, no longer sure of anything, knows that she cannot go on any more. When Olivia disappears, only Peter suspects that it may not be foul play, and he has to find her again. But where will they go from there? Five days in Paris is all they have. Home again, they must both pursue their lives, despite challenges, compromise and betrayal.

It is 1916 and Roberta Jewett is surprised to find that her hometown of Camden, Maine, considers a divorced woman little more than a prostitute. Condemned by her mother and scorned by neighbors, she nonetheless perseveres in her struggle to forge a good life for her girls and herself. Behaving like no “respectable” woman would, she gets a job as a county nurse, learns to drive, and buys her very own Model T. Embittered by her painful marriage to an unfaithful husband, she has no intention of being any man's victim again. So Roberta is taken aback to find the widowed carpenter Gabriel Farley has somehow found his way into her heart.

"Secrets of Power, Volume I",['Ingo Swann'],"Swann-Ryder Productions, LLC",2018-09-02,"Most books about power only deal with the societal formula of the few having power over the enormously larger powerless masses, and which is mistaken as the so-called ""natural order of power."" But it is not well understood that this formula also requires social conditioning measures aimed at perpetuating the continuing depowerment of the powerless so that the powerful CAN have power over them. This in turn requires the societal suppression and secretizing of all knowledge about the superlative human powers known to exist in individuals of the human species, but which are socially forced into latency in most. It is broadly understood that power and secrecy go together, but the scope of the ""web"" of secrets surrounding the larger nature of human power(s) is surprising. As discussed in this Volume I of SECRETS OF POWER, empowerment is difficult if the larger panorama of societal power and depowerment are not more full understood.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781949214444'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1949214443'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",228.0,BOOK,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",NOT_MATURE,True,0.11.4.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qIBuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qIBuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qIBuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ABSOLUTE+POWER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qIBuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qIBuDwAAQBAJ,,,Individual Empowerment vs the Societal Panorama of Power and Depowerment,,

Stella Payne is forty-two, divorced, a high-powered investment analyst, mother of eleven-year-old Quincy- and she does it all. In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love—and all of love's nasty fallout—anyway. But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core—not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean—and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101209127'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101209127'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",417.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.7.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6QdDnNZDd7YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6QdDnNZDd7YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6QdDnNZDd7YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:HOW+STELLA+GOT+HER+GROOVE+BACK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6QdDnNZDd7YC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6QdDnNZDd7YC,4.0,1.0,,,

Falling Up,['Melody Carlson'],Multnomah,2009-01-16,"Answer Girl Has a Zillion Questions. And Zero Answers Kim Peterson, the Just Ask Jamie “answer girl” is about plum out of them. As if losing her mother to cancer wasn’t enough, the hits just keep coming. Now living with Kim and her father, her aunt and cousin bicker nonstop. Dating Matthew is about as unpredictable as can be. Her dad’s out of a job. Her prayers go unanswered. And her best friend Natalie loses her virginity to Benjamin O’Conner, Caitlin’s brother! And—p.s.—now she’s pregnant! When the world turns upside down, and Kim is about to fall apart, can she perhaps fall up? Straight into the arms of the One who loves her through the madness of life? Friday, June 7 I think I’m having a serious meltdown here. It’s like I’m unable to reason, I can’t think straight, and I can’t get my feelings under control. Even my prayers are pathetic, just hopeless cries for help, with no faith involved. I’m a mess. How much stress can a girl take? Kim Peterson’s mom has just died. Her visiting relatives bicker constantly. Her dad is lost in a fog of grief. Her boyfriend, Matthew, can’t decide what to do after graduation. And Kim’s best friend Nat just can’t seem to get over being dumped by Ben O’Conner, Caitlin’s younger brother. More than anything, Kim wishes her mom were here to tell her everything’s going to be okay. But that’s not going to happen. When Kim reaches the breaking point, her dad sends her off to her grandmother’s house in small-town Florida, where she’s able to slow down, feed the gators, and realize that she’s not indispensable...only God is! And instead of falling apart, she can fall up...into His arms. Reader’s guide included Story Behind the Book “My teenage years remain vivid in my mind. It was a turbulent time full of sharp contrasts—love and hate, pain and pleasure, trust and doubt. Then, just as I reached my peak of questioning, rebelling, and seeking, I found God. And I found Him in a really big way! My life turned completely around and has, thankfully, never turned back. Hopefully this story will touch and change hearts—speaking to teen girls right where they live, reminding readers that God is alive and well and ready to be intimately involved in their lives right now!” —Melody Carlson","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307562999'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307562999'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",272.0,BOOK,['Young Adult Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.7.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPKCBtopVlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPKCBtopVlYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=oPKCBtopVlYC&pg=PA32&dq=intitle:FALLING+UP&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oPKCBtopVlYC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oPKCBtopVlYC,,,Kim: Book 3,,

With the Stroke of a Pen,['Kenneth Mayer'],Princeton University Press,2002-09,"The conventional wisdom holds that the president of the United States is weak, hobbled by the separation of powers and the short reach of his formal legal authority. In this first-ever in-depth study of executive orders, Kenneth Mayer deals a strong blow to this view. Taking civil rights and foreign policy as examples, he shows how presidents have used a key tool of executive power to wield their inherent legal authority and pursue policy without congressional interference. Throughout the nation's life, executive orders have allowed presidents to make momentous, unilateral policy choices: creating and abolishing executive branch agencies, reorganizing administrative and regulatory processes, handling emergencies, and determining how legislation is implemented. From the Louisiana Purchase to the Emancipation Proclamation, from Franklin Roosevelt's establishment of the Executive Office of the President to Bill Clinton's authorization of loan guarantees for Mexico, from Harry Truman's integration of the armed forces to Ronald Reagan's seizures of regulatory control, American presidents have used executive orders (or their equivalents) to legislate in ways that extend far beyond administrative activity. By analyzing the pattern of presidents' use of executive orders and the relationship of those orders to the presidency as an institution, Mayer describes an office much more powerful and active than the one depicted in the bulk of the political science literature. This distinguished work of scholarship shows that the U.S. presidency has a great deal more than the oft-cited ""power to persuade.""","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780691094991'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0691094993'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",309.0,BOOK,['Biography & Autobiography'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.3.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mug9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mug9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mug9DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:EXECUTIVE+ORDERS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mug9DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:EXECUTIVE+ORDERS&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/With_the_Stroke_of_a_Pen.html?hl=&id=mug9DwAAQBAJ,,,Executive Orders and Presidential Power,,

Bowman’s strange transformation into a Star Child is traced through the novels 2010 and 2061.

Poole discovers a world of human minds interfacing directly with computers, genetically engineered dinosaur servants, and massive space elevators built around the equator. He also discovers an impending threat to humanity lurking within the enigmatic monoliths. To fight it, Poole must join forces with Bowman and HAL, now fused into one corporeal consciousness—and the only being with the power to thwart the monoliths’ mysterious creators. “3001 is not just a page-turner, plugged in to the great icons of HAL and the monoliths, but a book of wisdom too, pithy and provocative.” —New Scientist","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780795324888'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '079532488X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",233.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.9.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MUEqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MUEqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MUEqAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:3001:+THE+FINAL+ODYSSEY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MUEqAAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:3001:+THE+FINAL+ODYSSEY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/3001.html?hl=&id=MUEqAAAAQBAJ,,,The Final Odyssey,,

But in the twenty years or more that followed, the three had moved on with their lives, settled in different cities, and found successful careers and new roles as mothers and wives. At a sprawling ranch in Wyoming the three women, each by chance finding themselves alone for a few weeks one summer, come together and find courage, healing and truth, and reach out to each other again. Once they shared everything, but now pretence between them runs high. Mary, married for twenty-two years to a Manhattan lawyer, masks the guilt and fear that her husband will never forgive her for their son's death. Tanya, a singer and rock star, enjoys all the trappings of fame and success - a mansion in Bel Air, legions of fans, and a broken heart - for the children she wanted but never had, and the men who have takehn advantage of her.

PRETEND YOU DON'T SEE HER,['Mary Higgins Clark'],Simon and Schuster,2011-11-29,"What happens when a young woman is accidentally caught up in a dangerous murder investigation, having merely been in the wrong place at the wrong time? Lacey Farrell, a rising star on the Manhattan real estate scene, is witness to a murder - and to the final words of the victim. The dying woman is convinced her attacker was after her dead daughter's journal, which Lacey gives to the police, but not before making a copy for herself. It's an impulse that later proves nearly fatal. Placed in the witness protection programme and sent to live in Minneapolis, Lacey must assume a fake identity, at least until the killer can be brought to trial. There she meets Tom Lynch, a radio talk-show host whom she tentatively begins to date - until the strain of her deception makes her break it off. Then she discovers the killer has traced her whereabouts. Armed with nothing more than her own courage and clues from the journal, Lacey heads back to New York determined to uncover who is behind the deaths of the two women… before she is the next casualty.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780073180809'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0073180807'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",324.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.7.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJP4jpeivqkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jJP4jpeivqkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jJP4jpeivqkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:PRETEND+YOU+DON%27T+SEE+HER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jJP4jpeivqkC&dq=intitle:PRETEND+YOU+DON%27T+SEE+HER&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/PRETEND_YOU_DON_T_SEE_HER.html?hl=&id=jJP4jpeivqkC,,,,,

In the winter of 1991, at a concert in Krakow, an older woman with a marvelously pitched violin meets a fellow musician who is instantly captivated by her instrument. When he asks her how she obtained it, she reveals the remarkable story behind its origin. . . . Imprisoned at Auschwitz, the notorious concentration camp, Daniel feels his humanity slipping away. Treasured memories of the young woman he loved and the prayers that once lingered on his lips become hazier with each passing day. Then a visit from a mysterious stranger changes everything, as Daniel’s former identity as a crafter of fine violins is revealed to all. The camp’s two most dangerous men use this information to make a cruel wager: If Daniel can build a successful violin within a certain number of days, the Kommandant wins a case of the finest burgundy. If not, the camp doctor, a torturer, gets hold of Daniel. And so, battling exhaustion, Daniel tries to recapture his lost art, knowing all too well the likely cost of failure.

The Winner Effect,['Ian H. Robertson'],Macmillan,2012-10-16,"What makes a winner? Why do some people succeed both in life and in business, and others fail? Why do a few individuals end up supremely powerful, while many remain powerless? The ""winner effect"" is a term used in biology to describe how an animal that has won a few fights against weak opponents is much more likely to win later bouts against stronger contenders. As Ian Robertson reveals, it applies to humans, too. Success changes the chemistry of the brain, making you more focused, smarter, more confident, and more aggressive. The effect is as strong as any drug. And the more you win, the more you will go on to win. But the downside is that winning can become physically addictive. By understanding what the mental and physical changes are that take place in the brain of a ""winner,"" how they happen, and why they affect some people more than others, Robertson answers the question of why some people attain and then handle success better than others. He explains what makes a winner—or a loser—and how we can use the answers to these questions to understand better the behavior of our business colleagues, family, friends, and ourselves.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250013644'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '125001364X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",322.0,BOOK,['Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,5.5.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VVasDSnfgT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VVasDSnfgT8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VVasDSnfgT8C&dq=intitle:THE+WINNER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VVasDSnfgT8C&dq=intitle:THE+WINNER&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Winner_Effect.html?hl=&id=VVasDSnfgT8C,,,The Neuroscience of Success and Failure,,

He knows the night as no one else ever will, ever can—the mystery, the beauty, the many terrors, and the eerie, silken rhythms of the night—for it is only at night that he is free. Until the night he witnesses a series of disturbing incidents that sweep him into a violent mystery only he can solve, a mystery that will force him to rise above all fears and confront the many-layered strangeness of Moonlight Bay and its residents. Once again drawing daringly from several genres, Dean Koontz has created a narrative that is a thriller, a mystery, a wild adventure, a novel of friendship, a rousing story of triumph over severe physical limitations, and a haunting cautionary tale. This ebook edition contains a special preview of Dean Koontz’s The Silent Corner.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307414106'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307414108'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",448.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.11.10.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AoJc_dumd0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AoJc_dumd0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=AoJc_dumd0wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FEAR+NOTHING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AoJc_dumd0wC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AoJc_dumd0wC,4.5,11.0,A Novel,,

De kruik van Pandora,,,2022,"Natalie Haynes bespreekt tien verschillende verhalen uit de Griekse mythologie vanuit een nieuw perspectief: ze stelt de vrouwen centraal Veel hedendaagse romans, toneelstukken en films halen hun inspiratie uit de epische poëzie en Griekse tragedies die bijna drieduizend jaar geleden voor het eerst werden verteld. In het werk van Homerus, in bijvoorbeeld de verhalen over de Trojaanse Oorlog en Jason en de Argonauten, gaat het om mannelijke helden. Vrouwen komen er meestal bekaaid vanaf. En als ze wel het onderwerp van gesprek zijn, worden ze vaak afgeschilderd als monsterlijk, wraakzuchtig of gewoon kwaadaardig. Neem Pandora, iedereen kent haar als de eerste vrouw die alle chaos en ellende in de wereld heeft losgelaten, maar in het oorspronkelijke verhaal van Hesiodus handelde zij helemaal niet uit kwade wil. Zelfs de verhalen over Medea en Phaedra zijn genuanceerder dan hervertellingen ons laten geloven. In De kruik van Pandora herstelt Natalie Haynes het evenwicht. Als startpunt neemt ze Pandora en haar kruik (die doos kwam later pas), en in nog negen verhalen zijn, na millennia van verhalen over goden en mannen, nu eindelijk eens de stemmen te horen van Hera, Artemis, Penelope en vele andere vrouwen. In de pers 'Het leukste boek over Griekse mythen dat je ooit zult lezen.' Mark Haddon, auteur van Het wonderlijke voorval met de hond in de nacht 'Grappige, scherpe analyses van wat deze soms-niet-erg-aardige vrouwen van plan waren, en hoe ze soms voor gek werden gezet... doorlezen!'

Instead, she was about to put herself in the gravest jeopardy of her career. Tom Newquist had been a detective in the Nota Lake sheriff's office--a tough, honest cop respected by everyone. When he died suddenly, the townsfolk were saddened but not surprised: Just shy of sixty-five, Newquist worked too hard, smoked too much, and exercised too little. That plus an appetite for junk food made him a poster boy for an American Heart Association campaign. Newquist's widow didn't doubt the coroner's report. But what Selma couldn't accept was not knowing what had so bothered Tom in the last six weeks of his life. What was it that had made him prowl restlessly at night, that had him brooding constantly? Selma Newquist wanted closure, and the only way she'd get it was if she found out what it was that had so bedeviled her husband. Kinsey should have dumped the case. It was vague and hopeless, like looking for a needle in a haystack. Instead, she set up shop in Nota Lake, where she found that looking for a needle in a haystack can draw blood.

Secret Prey,['John Sandford'],Simon and Schuster,2018-11-29,"A Lucas Davenport thriller by internationally bestselling novelist John Sandford Five men go hunting. Only four come back alive. It's up to Lucas Davenport to untangle the secrets that bind these men together and uncover his prey... The company chairman lay on the cold ground of the woods, his eyes unseeing, his orange hunting jacket punctured by a rifle bullet at close range. Around him stood the four executives with whom he had been hunting, each with his or her own complicated agenda, each with a reason not to be sorrowful about the man's death. If he read it in a book, Lucas Davenport thought, it would seem like one of those classic murder mysteries, the kind where the detective gathers everyone together at the end and solves the case with a little speech. But it wasn't going to be that easy, he knew. There were currents running through this group, hints and whispers of something much greater than the murder of a single man. He had felt this way not long before, sensed the curling of an indefinable evil, and not only had it nearly gotten him killed, it had lost him the woman he loves. Sometime soon, unless he could stop it, there would be another death, and then still another, and Davenport couldn't help but wonder if maybe this time, the final death might not be his own. . . .

I Know This Much Is True,['Wally Lamb'],Harper,1998-06-03,"With his stunning debut novel, She's Come Undone, Wally Lamb won the adulation of critics and readers with his mesmerizing tale of one woman's painful yet triumphant journey of self-discovery. Now, this brilliantly talented writer returns with I Know This Much Is True, a heartbreaking and poignant multigenerational saga of the reproductive bonds of destruction and the powerful force of forgiveness. A masterpiece that breathtakingly tells a story of alienation and connection, power and abuse, devastation and renewal--this novel is a contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth. A proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world. When you're the same brother of a schizophrenic identical twin, the tricky thing about saving yourself is the blood it leaves on your bands--the little inconvenience of the look-alike corpse at your feet. And if you're into both survival of the fittest and being your brother's keeper--if you've promised your dying mother--then say so long to sleep and hello to the middle of the night. Grab a book or a beer. Get used to Letterman's gap-toothed smile of the absurd, or the view of the bedroom ceiling, or the influence of random selection. Take it from a godless insomniac. Take it from the uncrazy twin--the guy who beat the biochemical rap. Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother he both deeply loves and resents, and by the past they shared with their adoptive father, Ray, a spit-and-polish ex-Navy man (the five-foot-six-inch sleeping giant who snoozed upstairs weekdays in the spare room and built submarines at night), and their long-suffering mother, Concettina, a timid woman with a harelip that made her shy and self-conscious: She holds a loose fist to her face to cover her defective mouth--her perpetual apology to the world for a birth defect over which she'd had no control. Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful ""monkey""; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle ""bunny."" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness--and ultimately self-protection--in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. I was still afraid of his anger but saw how he punished weakness--pounced on it. Out of self-preservation I hid my fear, Dominick confesses. As for Thomas, he just never knew how to play defense. He just didn't get it. But Dominick's talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors--a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather and a namesake Domenico Tempesta, the sostegno del famiglia, was born. Each of the stories Ma told us about Papa reinforced the message that he was the boss, that he ruled the roost, that what he said went. Searching for answers, Dominick turns to the whispers of the dead, to the pages of his grandfather's handwritten memoir, The History of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings. Rendered with touches of magic realism, Domenico's fablelike tale--in which monkeys enchant and religious statues weep--becomes the old man's confession--an unwitting legacy of contrition that reveals the truth's of Domenico's life, Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary reading experience that will leave no reader untouched.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0060391626'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780060391621'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",914.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.21.15.0.full.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:I+KNOW+THIS+MUCH+IS+TRUE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v9uqxTiOxq8C,5.0,1.0,,,

The Poisonwood Bible,['Barbara Kingsolver'],Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"New York Times Bestseller • Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize • An Oprah's Book Club Selection “Powerful . . . [Kingsolver] has with infinitely steady hands worked the prickly threads of religion, politics, race, sin and redemption into a thing of terrible beauty.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review The Poisonwood Bible, now celebrating its 25th anniversary, established Barbara Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, it is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in Africa. The story is told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Against this backdrop, Orleanna Price reconstructs the story of her evangelist husband's part in the Western assault on Africa, a tale indelibly darkened by her own losses and unanswerable questions about her own culpability. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four daughters—the teenaged Rachel; adolescent twins Leah and Adah; and Ruth May, a prescient five-year-old. These sharply observant girls, who arrive in the Congo with racial preconceptions forged in 1950s Georgia, will be marked in surprisingly different ways by their father's intractable mission, and by Africa itself. Ultimately each must strike her own separate path to salvation. Their passionately intertwined stories become a compelling exploration of moral risk and personal responsibility.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061804816'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061804819'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",578.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.18.15.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+POISONWOOD+BIBLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q69PhJN-TbwC,5.0,1.0,A Novel,,

What Tabitha does take seriously is hunting and killing vampires-and soon she and Val have to grapple with the deadliest of all Daimons-one who's managed to come back from the dead, and one who holds a serious grudge against both of them. To win against evil, Val will have to loosen up, learn to trust, and put everything on the line to protect a man he hates and a woman who drives him nuts.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429906159'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429906154'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",351.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.12.10.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NkyLZrpxrR4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NkyLZrpxrR4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NkyLZrpxrR4C&pg=PA4&dq=intitle:SEIZE+THE+NIGHT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NkyLZrpxrR4C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NkyLZrpxrR4C,4.5,18.0,A Dark-Hunter Novel,,

U begrijpt: de spreekwoordelijke goudmijn voor een schrijver. Brigadier oversteekmoeder staat dan ook vol met Bruers' herinneringen aan een ongebruikelijke jeugd, haar confrontaties met buurvrouw Netty , fervent koppelaarster, en andere merkwaardige voorvallen uit haar incidentrijke leven.

A New Song,['D. P. Myers'],WestBow Press,2016-06-10,"The Psalms frequently issue a call to sing a new song unto the Lord. While this call is often thought to refer to singing the Psalms or even other songs written by those more gifted than ourselves, Myers suggests such is not the primary intention. For as we are all beings created in the image of God, we are all called to create new songs in response to the word and work of God. It is with this in mind that Myers encourages the Christ-follower to consider a new approach to time spent in Scripture. The reader is encouraged to meditate on the Psalms and then respond with a unique song of worship to God. By seeking to create a new worshipful response to the Psalms the reader may find that the inevitably dry devotional times that nearly all of us encounter have been invigorated. A New Song is both a devotional and a guidebook. As a devotional, the reader is offered a glimpse into Myers multi-year journey through the Psalms resulting in the writing of over 170 poems. Each poem, when read alongside the accompanying Psalm, can help the prayerful reader to consider the ways in which God may be speaking through each Psalm. As a guidebook, A New Song briefly discusses our innate creative nature and then offers suggestions which, when illustrated by Myers examples, will encourage you to find your own creative voice with which to sing a new song unto the Lord.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781512741704'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1512741701'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",228.0,BOOK,['Poetry'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IklmDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IklmDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IklmDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+NEW+SONG&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IklmDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IklmDAAAQBAJ,,,Responding Poetically to the Psalms,,

Hannibal in de Alpen,['Jona Lendering'],Omniboek,2022-01-18,"In ‘Hannibal in de Alpen’ legt Jona Lendering uit waarom we niet kunnen weten waar de Karthaagse veldheer Hannibal in 218 v.Chr. Italië binnenviel en toont hij de veelkleurigheid van de oudheidkunde. In het najaar van 218 v.Chr. trekt de Karthaagse veldheer Hannibal in vijftien dagen over de Alpen. Zijn vijanden, de Romeinen, waren hier nauwelijks op voorbereid en door deze operatie veranderde het verloop van de Tweede Punische Oorlog (218-201 v.Chr.). De vraag over welke pas het Karthaagse leger Italië binnenviel, houdt de gemoederen al twee eeuwen bezig. In ‘Hannibal in de Alpen’ benut Jona Lendering het op zich onbeduidende vraagstuk om te tonen waar oudheidkundigen zich zoal mee bezighouden. De overlevering van antieke teksten, de stereotypen waarvan antieke auteurs zich bedienden, klimaatreconstructie, het antieke landschap en de darmflora van zoogdieren behoren tot de onderwerpen die aan de orde komen. ‘Hannibal in de Alpen’ gaat over de oudheid maar vooral over de veelkleurigheid van de oudheidkunde.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789401918015'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9401918015'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",131.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wM87EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wM87EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wM87EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:HANNIBAL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wM87EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wM87EAAAQBAJ,,,Een puzzel uit de oudheid,,

But in another time, another place, there had been dancing, people, laughter, love... She was the cherished grandmother who sang songs in Russian, loved to roller-skate, and spoke little of her past. But when Granny Dan died, all that remained was a box wrapped in brown paper. Inside, an old pair of satin ballet shoes, a gold locket, and a stack of letters tied with ribbon. It was her legacy, a secret past, waiting to be discovered by the granddaughter who loved her but never really knew her. It was a story waiting to be told... The year was 1902. A motherless young girl arrived at ballet school in St Petersburg.

Through the story of the kidnapping of a baby, the notion of personal history as received fiction is examined. The novel asks: what makes a family? Is it mere kinship through blood, or something more profound and intricate? What keeps it together? What tears it apart? The action of the novel is seen through the eyes of a baby's mother, the kidnapper and the child itself. Dramatic, blackly funny and tragically topical, MOTHER OF PEARL is a remarkable achievement.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781473524866'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1473524865'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",240.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.5.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1cWzCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1cWzCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1cWzCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MOTHER+OF+PEARL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1cWzCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1cWzCgAAQBAJ,,,,,

Black Notice,['Lotte Petri'],Lindhardt og Ringhof,2021-12-30,"In een onbewogen kustplaatsje, net buiten Kopenhagen, schijnt er een verdacht licht op de bodem van de haven. Om deze reden schakelt de politie een militare duiker in, die gespecialiseerd is in het onderzoeken van plaats delicten onder water. Al snel blijkt dat er in het diepe een auto ligt, met het verminkte lijk van een jonge vrouw in de bestuurdersstoel. Het lijkt erop dat ze het slachtoffer is van een sadistische moordenaar, die haar aan een gruwelijke operatie heeft onderworpen. Op ruige kliffen, aan de rand van een landelijk plaatsje in het zuiden van Noorwegen, vindt een wandelaar een deel van een lijk, dat gekleed is een wetsuit. De lokale politie probeert de identiteit van het slachtoffer te achterhalen. Daarom sturen ze een black notice – een verzoek tot informatie over een ongeidentificeerd lijk – naar Interpol. Kort hierna wordt er in Nederland het lijk van een ander meisje gevonden, eveneens in een wetsuit. Even later wordt er in het meer van een bos het levenloze en ijskoude lichaam van nog een vrouw gevonden, met littekens die lijken op die van de andere slachtoffers. Ze zou de voornaamste getuige van de politie kunnen zijn – als ze haar uit de dood konden terughalen. Black Notice is een bloedstollende Scandi noir over een internationale jacht op een sadistische en meedogenloze seriemoordenaar. Het verhaal is voor een deel gebaseerd op waargebeurde misdrijven en een uitstekende keuze voor fans van de boeken van Jo Nesbo, Samuel Bjork en Cara Hunter. Lotte Petri is een Deense auteur van misdaadromans. Als de dochter van een psychiater is Petri opgegroeid in een omgeving waar psychologische afwijkingen een alledaags onderwerp waren, en die achtergrond komt op een duistere manier naar voren in haar boeken. Na een carrière in marketing, en een studie filosofie, besloot Petri haar schrijversdroom achterna te gaan. In 2009 werd haar eerste boek genomineerd voor de Debuut van het Jaar-prijs van Danske Bank. Haar Selma Eliassen-reeks werd door critici geprezen en in 2017 verscheen het eerste boek in de reeks rondom forensisch expert Josefine Jespersen.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9788726896091'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '8726896095'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",203.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FURVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FURVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FURVEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BLACK+NOTICE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FURVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FURVEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

Carolina Moon,['Nora Roberts'],Penguin,2001-04-01,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts presents a novel of redemption and suspense, as a woman haunted by the unsolved murder of her childhood friend returns to her small South Carolina hometown. . . . Tory Bodeen grew up in a run-down house where her father ruled with an iron fist and a leather belt—and where her dreams and talents had no room to flourish. Her one escape was her neighbor Hope, who lived in the big house just a short skip away, and whose friendship allowed Tory to be something she wasn’t allowed to be at home: a child. Then Hope was brutally murdered, and everything fell apart. Now, as she returns to Progress with plans to settle in and open a stylish home-design shop, Tory is determined to find a measure of peace and free herself from the haunting visions of the past. As she forges a new bond with Cade Lavelle—Hope’s older brother and the heir to the family fortune—she isn’t sure whether the tragic loss they share will unite them or drive them apart.

The Bluest Eye,['Toni Morrison'],Vintage,2007-07-24,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • A PARADE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME • From the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner—a powerful examination of our obsession with beauty and conformity that asks questions about race, class, and gender with characteristic subtly and grace. In Morrison’s acclaimed first novel, Pecola Breedlove—an 11-year-old Black girl in an America whose love for its blond, blue-eyed children can devastate all others—prays for her eyes to turn blue: so that she will be beautiful, so that people will look at her, so that her world will be different. This is the story of the nightmare at the heart of her yearning, and the tragedy of its fulfillment. Here, Morrison’s writing is “so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry” (The New York Times).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307386588'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307386589'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",226.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.15.15.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12_KUGLXigMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=12_KUGLXigMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=12_KUGLXigMC&dq=intitle:THE+BLUEST+EYE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=12_KUGLXigMC&dq=intitle:THE+BLUEST+EYE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bluest_Eye.html?hl=&id=12_KUGLXigMC,4.0,29.0,,,

De medische omerta,['Jim Reekers'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2023-09-02,"Geneeskunde is vaak niet meer dan een door de medische industrie gecontroleerde promotie van geneesmiddelen en behandelingen. Artsen en de medische industrie maken handig gebruik van de commerciële mogelijkheden van ons zorgsysteem; ethiek, transparantie en zorgzaamheid staan daarbij niet altijd voorop. Soms wordt een patiënt bijvoorbeeld een betere behandeling onthouden, alleen vanwege het inkomen van de arts. De marktwerking in de zorg heeft een extreme toename van kosten veroorzaakt. Iedereen weet dat het anders moet, maar iedereen beschermt de eigen positie, waardoor zorg steeds minder beschikbaar zal zijn. Jim Reekers schrijft kritisch over de zwijgcultuur binnen de zorg, en geeft aan wat er beter kan, op zeker een tiental terreinen. ‘Want,’ zo schrijft hij, ‘ik blijf een optimist’. Jim Reekers is emeritus-hoogleraar in de interventieradiologie en was 37 jaar werkzaam in het AMC in Amsterdam. Hij heeft vele wetenschappelijke publicaties op zijn naam staan en bekleedde diverse bestuursfuncties 'Een moedig, openhartig en scherp slijpend boek.’ – Roger van Boxtel ‘Jim Reekers kent als geen ander de medische wereld. En er is niemand beter in staat die wereld onder de microscoop te leggen, van de jacht op declarabele verrichtingen tot uit winstbejag gedreven kwakzalverij, en nog veel meer.

Drowning Ruth,['Christina Schwarz'],Ballantine Books,2008-11-19,"Deftly written and emotionally powerful, Drowning Ruth is a stunning portrait of the ties that bind sisters together and the forces that tear them apart, of the dangers of keeping secrets and the explosive repercussions when they are exposed. A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut. Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night. Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered. Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307484055'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '030748405X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",370.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.8.7.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hdn0sVWOPhwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hdn0sVWOPhwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hdn0sVWOPhwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DROWNING+RUTH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hdn0sVWOPhwC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hdn0sVWOPhwC,4.5,6.0,A Novel,,

'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Physically and psychologically bruised by her encounter with the killer Chandonne, Dr Kay Scarpetta has to leave her home in the hands of the police team investigating the attack. She finds shelter with an old friend, Anna Zenner, but it is not the haven of security she needs when she discovers that Anna has been sub-poenaed to appear before a Grand Jury which is investigating Scarpetta for murder. Kay knows she is being framed and she also knows she can trust no-one. Meanwhile it appears that Chandonne killed a woman in New York before his murderous spree in Virginia, but when Scarpetta looks more closely into that case with the NY prosecutor Jaime Berger, proof of his guilt is far from certain - in fact she begins to believe that he may not be the perpetrator of any of the crimes he is accused of. As she follows the forensic trail to the real killer she gradually realises that someone has been spinning a web for years with the aim of entrapping her.

Merrick,['Anne Rice'],Lindhardt og Ringhof,2018-05-01,"David, Lestat og Louis er flyttet sammen i en lejlighed i New Orleans, men deres hverdag præges af Louis‘ bekymring for den lille vampyrpige Claudia, som døde for mange år siden. Han har hørt, at hendes genfærd er blevet set i byen, og han frygter, at hun ikke har kunnet finde fred. Derfor beder han David opsøge Merrick – en ung heks som nedstammer fra de frie farvede, en befolkningsgruppe i det gamle New Orleans der bekendte sig til magi og voodoo. Måske kan Merrick skabe kontakt til Claudia, så han kan få svar på sine spørgsmål. Men for David bliver mødet med Merrick smertefuldt. Ikke blot ripper det op i minderne om deres fælles rejse til Guatemalas jungle, hvor de ledte efter en værdifuld skat i mayafolkets ruiner, men det vækker også den kærlighed til live, som han siden da har forsøgt at undertrykke. Anne Rices ""Vampyrkrøniken"" består til dato af 12 bøger, hvoraf de 9 er oversat til dansk. Første bind i serien, ""En vampyrs bekendelser"", om vampyrerne Louis og Lestat blev i 1994 filmatiseret med Tom Cruise og Brad Pitt i hovedrollerne.

On the Street where You Live: Victoria's early roads and railways,['Danda Humphreys'],Heritage House Publishing Co,2000,"In the mid-1800s, Victoria grew from a fur-trading post into a provincial capital--the jewel in British Columbia's golden crown. Meanwhile, many of the early residents, happy to leave the Hudson's Bay Company behind, followed simple trails from the fort or discovered new routes of their own. In her first book, Danda Humphreys introduced readers to some of the people who forged those pioneer pathways. Now she takes us another step back in time to the roads and railways that connected the original city's core to today's suburbs. From Saanich to Sooke, street names tell stories of intrigue and adventure: Rowland Avenue, named for the farm labourer with a sinister sideline: hangman for the HBC. Joan Crescent, where coal baron Robert Dunsmuir's widow once resided in solitary splendour in a castle called Craigdarroch. Sidney Avenue, close to where the Brethour brothers donated land for the northern terminus of the ""Cordwood Express,"" first train to link the city with the Saanich Peninsula and the islands in the Strait of Georgia. In this second book in her On the Street Where You Live trilogy, Danda once again combines her passion for the past with a penchant for lively prose to bring you stories about Victoria's pioneers. You know the streets; now meet the people--their lives, their loves and the legends they left behind.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1894384091'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781894384094'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",196.0,BOOK,['Biography & Autobiography'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.5.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w0PkSTOAjgQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=w0PkSTOAjgQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=w0PkSTOAjgQC&pg=PA7&dq=intitle:ON+THE+STREET+WHERE+YOU+LIVE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=w0PkSTOAjgQC&dq=intitle:ON+THE+STREET+WHERE+YOU+LIVE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_Street_where_You_Live_Victoria_s.html?hl=&id=w0PkSTOAjgQC,,,,,

Any Way the Wind Blows,['Rainbow Rowell'],Wednesday Books,2021-07-06,"New York Times bestselling author Rainbow Rowell's epic fantasy, the Simon Snow trilogy, concludes with Any Way the Wind Blows. In Carry On, Simon Snow and his friends realized that everything they thought they understood about the world might be wrong. And in Wayward Son, they wondered whether everything they understood about themselves might be wrong. Now, Simon and Baz and Penelope and Agatha must decide how to move forward. For Simon, that means choosing whether he still wants to be part of the World of Mages — and if he doesn't, what does that mean for his relationship with Baz? Meanwhile Baz is bouncing between two family crises and not finding any time to talk to anyone about his newfound vampire knowledge. Penelope would love to help, but she's smuggled an American Normal into London, and now she isn't sure what to do with him. And Agatha? Well, Agatha Wellbelove has had enough. Any Way the Wind Blows takes the gang back to England, back to Watford, and back to their families for their longest and most emotionally wrenching adventure yet. This book is a finale. It tells secrets and answers questions and lays ghosts to rest. The Simon Snow Trilogy was conceived as a book about Chosen One stories; Any Way the Wind Blows is an ending about endings—about catharsis and closure, and how we choose to move on from the traumas and triumphs that try to define us.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250254344'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250254345'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",450.0,BOOK,['Young Adult Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mFz2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mFz2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mFz2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ANY+WAY+THE+WIND+BLOWS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mFz2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mFz2DwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Corrections,['Jonathan Franzen'],"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",2001-09-15,"Winner of the 2001 National Book Award for Fiction Nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award An American Library Association Notable Book Jonathan Franzen's third novel, The Corrections, is a great work of art and a grandly entertaining overture to our new century: a bold, comic, tragic, deeply moving family drama that stretches from the Midwest at mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of greed and globalism. Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With The Corrections, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul. Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says. Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a ""transgressive"" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay. Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints. Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429928618'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429928611'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",577.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.9.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FodGfz5li5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FodGfz5li5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FodGfz5li5wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+CORRECTIONS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FodGfz5li5wC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FodGfz5li5wC,4.0,48.0,A Novel,,

Ever since he first saw Manet Hall, he'd been enchanted—and obsessed—with it. Determined to restore the mansion to its former splendor, Declan begins the daunting renovation room by room. But the days spent in total isolation in the empty house take a toll. He sees visions of days from a century past and experiences sensations of terror and nearly unbearable grief. Local legend has it that the house is haunted, and with every passing day Declan's belief in the ghostly presence grows. Only the companionship of alluring Angelina Simone can distract him from the mysterious happenings in the house, but Angelina has her own surprising connection to Manet Hall—a connection that will help Declan uncover a secret that's been buried for a hundred years.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101146545'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101146540'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,5.36.27.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GgngtQKr8GUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GgngtQKr8GUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=GgngtQKr8GUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MIDNIGHT+BAYOU&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GgngtQKr8GUC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GgngtQKr8GUC,5.0,7.0,,,

Coming Out Under Fire,['Allan Berube'],Simon and Schuster,1990,"Among the many histories of fighting men and women in World War II, little has been written about the thousands of homosexuals who found themselves fighting two wars--one for their country, the other for their own survival as targets of a military policy that sought their discharge as ""undesirables."" To write this long overdue chapter of American history, Allan Bérubé spent ten years interviewing gay and lesbian veterans, unearthed hundreds of wartime letters between gay GIs, and obtained thousands of pages of newly declassified government documents. While some gay and lesbian soldiers collapsed under the fear of being arrested, interrogated, discharged, and publicly humiliated, many drew strength from deep wartime friendships. Relying on their own secret culture of slang, body language, and ""camp"" to find each other and build spontaneous communities, they learned, both on and off the battlefield, to be proud of their contribution and of who they were.--From publisher description.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780743210713'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0743210719'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",396.0,BOOK,['Comics & Graphic Novels'],MATURE,False,0.3.2.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:UNDER+FIRE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC&dq=intitle:UNDER+FIRE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Coming_Out_Under_Fire.html?hl=&id=H-Lo5vA6lSYC,,,,True,
The Millionaire Mind,['Thomas J. Stanley'],Rosetta Books,2010-12-03,"The New York Times bestseller that gives “readers with an entrepreneurial turn of mind . . . road maps on how millionaires found their niches” (USA Today). The author of the blockbuster bestseller The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America’s Wealthy shows how self-made millionaires have surmounted shortcomings such as average intelligence by carefully choosing their careers, taking calculated risks, and living balanced lifestyles while maintaining their integrity. Dr. Thomas J. Stanley also builds on his research from The Millionaire Next Door and takes us further into the psyche of the American millionaire. Stanley focuses in on the top one percent of households in America and tells us the motor behind the engine; what makes them tick. His findings on how these families reached such financial success are based on in-depth surveys and interviews with more than thirteen hundred millionaires. “A very good book that deserves to be well read.” —The Wall Street Journal “Worth every cent . . . It’s an inspiration for anyone who has ever been told that he wasn’t smart enough or good enough.” —Associated Press “A high IQ isn’t necessarily an indicator of financial success . . .

The Locked-up Country,"['Shahar Hameiri', 'Tom Chodor']",Univ. of Queensland Press,2023-10-31,"Donald Horne famously called Australia &‘ the lucky country' . So how did we become the locked-up country and how might the future look different? Australia has changed enormously since Horne' s 1960s, but its response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the enduring truth of his thesis that our &‘ luck' was undeserved and wouldn' t last. By closing its borders and imposing a nationally coordinated lockdown, Australia unexpectedly eliminated COVID-19 in 2020, achieving one of the world' s lowest excess mortality rates. But as governments proceeded to bungle key planks of the pandemic response, by mid-2021, Australia was &‘ locked up' &– closed off to the world and fragmented along state and territory borders, with its major cities enduring repeated and extended lockdowns. It soon became clear that Australia' s regulatory state had let us down. But these failures were not inevitable, and we can manage future crises more successfully. In The Locked-up Country, political experts Tom Chodor and Shahar Hameiri identify the source of Australia' s recent challenges and suggest a better way forward.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780702267475'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0702267473'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",133.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=34bwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=34bwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=34bwEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=intitle:UP+COUNTRY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=34bwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=34bwEAAAQBAJ,,,Learning the Lessons from Australia’s COVID-19 Response,,

Now a major motion picture starring Scarlett Johansson and Laura Linney. Wanted: One young woman to take care of four-year-old boy. Must be cheerful, enthusiastic and selfless--bordering on masochistic. Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived preschooler. Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family. Must enjoy the delicious anticipation of ridiculously erratic pay. Mostly, must love being treated like fungus found growing out of employers Hermès bag. Those who take it personally need not apply. Who wouldn't want this job?

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones,['R A Salvatore'],Random House,2012-09-30,"There is great disturbance in the Force . . . Mischievous and resolved, courageous to the point of recklessness, Anakin Skywalker has come of age in a time of great upheaval. The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin’s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala’s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin’s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat. The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi’s perception of the events. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a slow rumble is building into the roar of thousands of soldiers readying for battle. But even as the Republic falters around them, Anakin and Padmé find a connection so intense that all else begins to fall away. Anakin will lose himself—and his way—in emotions a Jedi, sworn to hold allegiance only to the Order, is forbidden to have. Based on the story by George Lucas and the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, this intense and revealing novel by bestselling author R. A.

SAMENVATTING - Ice On Fire / IJs in vuur en vlam door Leila Conners,['Shortcut Edition'],Shortcut Edition,,"Terwijl je deze samenvatting leest, zul je ontdekken dat menselijke activiteiten de planeet en haar ecosystemen in hoog tempo vernietigen. Je zult ook ontdekken : dat CO2 de belangrijkste reden is voor de huidige klimaatverandering; wat de nieuwe en niet minder ernstige bedreigingen zijn in verband met methaan; dat er veel oplossingen zijn om de impact van luchtvervuiling te minimaliseren of zelfs om te keren; dat politieke beslissingen genomen moeten worden op basis van wetenschappelijke argumenten en niet op basis van industriële argumenten. Sinds de eerste industriële revolutie in 1850 heeft de mens 1400 miljard ton CO2 in de atmosfeer gebracht. Dit is genoeg om de schade aan te tonen die CO2 heeft aangericht aan natuurlijke ecosystemen, vooral in het noordpoolgebied, waar het ijs in een alarmerend tempo smelt. De wetenschap legt een duidelijk oorzakelijk verband tussen de verbranding van fossiele brandstoffen, het vrijkomen van broeikasgassen en de opwarming van de aarde. De toekomst is echter niet onherroepelijk gedoemd: er zijn alternatieven voor fossiele brandstoffen en technologieën om CO2 uit de atmosfeer te verwijderen. De zeldzaamste hulpbron is echter tijd. Daarom moeten we nu antwoorden zoeken vanuit de wetenschap!

Then there is Tot Whooten, the beautician whose luck is as bad as her hairdressing skills; Beatrice Woods, the Little Blind Songbird; Cecil Figgs, the Funeral King; and the fabulous Minnie Oatman, lead vocalist of the Oatman Family Gospel Singers. The time is 1946 until the present. The town is Elmwood Springs, Missouri, right in the middle of the country, in the midst of the mostly joyous transition from war to peace, aiming toward a dizzyingly bright future.

Pierce tumbles through a hole, abandoning his orderly life in a frantic race to save the life of a woman he has never met.

Answered Prayers,['Truman Capote'],Vintage,2012-05-15,"Although Truman Capote's last novel was unfinished at the time of his death, its surviving portions offer a devastating group portrait of the high and low society of his time. ""Prose that makes the heart sing and the narrative fly."" —The New York Times Book Review Tracing the career of a writer of uncertain parentage and omnivorous erotic tastes, Answered Prayers careens from a louche bar in Tangiers to a banquette at La Côte Basque, from literary salons to high-priced whorehouses. It takes in calculating beauties and sadistic husbands along with such real-life supporting characters as Colette, the Duchess of Windsor, Montgomery Clift, and Tallulah Bankhead. Above all, this malevolently finny book displays Capote at his most relentlessly observant and murderously witty.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345803047'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345803043'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",208.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,4.10.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YDkukfasMR8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YDkukfasMR8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YDkukfasMR8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ANSWERED+PRAYERS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YDkukfasMR8C&dq=intitle:ANSWERED+PRAYERS&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Answered_Prayers.html?hl=&id=YDkukfasMR8C,3.0,1.0,,,

ABUNDANCE Is Your Birthright,['RONI BISSETT'],Trafford Publishing,2013,"Learning to live abundantly is the ability to see, feel, believe, and expect abundance and prosperity in all areas of life-financially, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Unfortunately what often holds us back from achieving abundance is what we believe deep inside about ourselves, our potentials, and our limitations. In her hands-on, step-by-step teaching manual, seasoned psychotherapist Roni Bissett shares practical tips and accompanying exercises that invite others to define their own meaning of abundance and create the lives they have always wanted to live. Bissett, a marriage and family counselor who has conducted numerous workshops on the art of living life abundantly, believes that if we lack abundance and prosperity in our lives, it is not because there is an absence of these things; instead, it is because we believe there is. While reinforcing the phrase ""what we believe we create,"" Bissett explains how you can realize a happier existence through a series of steps that encourage you to look inward and - change thought patterns from negative into positive; - use the tools of the conscious mind to achieve goals; - identify prosperity barriers and attitudes about money; and - alter thinking through visualization and meditation. Abundance Is Your Birthright is an innovative guidebook that shares valuable advice for anyone ready to bring his or her unique definition of abundance into reality and ultimately achieve true happiness.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781426972805'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1426972806'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",81.0,BOOK,['Self-Help'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZQ2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qZQ2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qZQ2AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BIRTHRIGHT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=qZQ2AAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:BIRTHRIGHT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/ABUNDANCE_Is_Your_Birthright.html?hl=&id=qZQ2AAAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Guardian of Lore,"['Vanessa Balleza', 'Navdeep Singh', 'Daniel Errico']",,2020-12-26,"While drawing in class to avoid listening to a story from his painfully boring teacher at Stagwood School, 12-year old Cal sees a frog staring at him through the window. Odder than that is the fact that this frog happens to be wearing glasses.Cal and his best friend, the tactless but loyal Soy, learn that the frog (who prefers the name Deli) has sought them out for a reason. When a school administrator named Ream reveals himself to be a dragon, the boys discover that fairytales are real, and that there is magic afoot in Stagwood. With Ream on their tail, the trio must unearth a powerful tool protected by riddles and rile (the magic that fuels nightmares) to save the fate of all fairytales past. Their only means on conveyance, Cal's now-flying bed, takes them on a journey beyond the home of the fairies (a cloud floating somewhere over Iceland) to set things right. But, before Cal can defeat Ream and his kidnapped army of fairies, he has to deal with Soy's knack for arguing with magical creatures, discover the truth about Deli's identity, and earn his place as the hero of the story.The Guardians of Lore is a middle grade novel that centers around two life-long friends, infusing humor and fantasy-based riddles into a modern fairytale. This is an exceptionally written intriguing piece of work that enthuses and imbues curiosity in young readers to discover the unknown with a spirit of adventure.

Murder List,['Julie Garwood'],Ballantine Books,2004-08-31,"There are few authors who can weave nail-biting thrills, edge-of-your-seat drama, and romantic suspense as masterfully as Julie Garwood. Now she ratchets up the tension with Murder List, in which evil is on the hunt– and proves to be methodically organized and chillingly successful. When Chicago detective Alec Buchanan is offered a prime position with the FBI, it is the perfect opportunity to leave the Windy City and follow in his brothers’ footsteps to the top echelons of law enforcement. But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo–and the victim is no stranger. Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar. At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little “cleansing” exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist? Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call–and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot. The experience is all but forgotten–until the first person on Regan’s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move–and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345480408'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345480406'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",485.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.9.8.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yzjid0NEwo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yzjid0NEwo8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Yzjid0NEwo8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MURDER+LIST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yzjid0NEwo8C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yzjid0NEwo8C,,,,,

Yet the cautious, fussy Norrell is challenged by the emergence of another magician: the brilliant novice Jonathan Strange. Young, handsome and daring, Strange is the very antithesis of Norrell. So begins a dangerous battle between these two great men which overwhelms that between England and France. And their own obsessions and secret dabblings with the dark arts are going to cause more trouble than they can imagine.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781408803745'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1408803747'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",1026.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.31.23.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTG1BM3u8MoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xTG1BM3u8MoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xTG1BM3u8MoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:JONATHAN+STRANGE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xTG1BM3u8MoC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xTG1BM3u8MoC,4.5,6.0,,,

One-hour Skirmish Wargames,['John Lambshead'],Pen and Sword,2018-09-30,"Many wargamers enjoy the challenge of skirmish games where, instead of the strategy of vast armies portrayed by traditional wargames, the focus is on the tactics of a small unit. However, skirmish rules are often so complex that it can take hours of rolling dice, consulting tables and recording data to recreate what would in reality be a fast and furious firefight lasting just minutes. Now these new rules make it possible to recapture the speed and intensity of these actions where every man, and every second, counts. The basic rules are supported by sections which give special rules and scenarios to capture the flavor of a range of different periods, from Napoleonic to Modern Warfare and beyond with Sci-Fi. From the 95th Rifles scouting for Wellington, Western gunfights and WWI trench raids, through WW2 parachute assaults or Special Forces strikes in Afghanistan, or even Space Marines storming a space station, Squad Firefights elegantly simple system allows you to focus on proper tactical decisions rather than rolling buckets of dice or calculating masses of modifiers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781526700063'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1526700069'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",135.0,BOOK,['Games & Activities'],NOT_MATURE,True,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x4ivDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x4ivDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4ivDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:HOUR+GAME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4ivDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:HOUR+GAME&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/One_hour_Skirmish_Wargames.html?hl=&id=x4ivDwAAQBAJ,,,Fast-play Dice-less Rules for Small-unit Actions from Napoleonics to Sci-Fi,,

This book is about understanding this choice, what considerations are important to think about when deciding, and the consequences of such choices for the individual scientist and the broader scientific enterprise. Rather than prescribing what course of action each scientist ought to take, the book aims to identify a range of options for individual scientists to consider in making their own judgments about how they would like to position themselves in relation to policy and politics. Using examples from a range of scientific controversies and thought-provoking analogies from other walks of life, The Honest Broker challenges us all - scientists, politicians and citizens - to think carefully about how best science can contribute to policy-making and a healthy democracy.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781139464826'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1139464825'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",198.0,BOOK,['Political Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,4.5.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WVLDn7J1erMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WVLDn7J1erMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=WVLDn7J1erMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+BROKER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WVLDn7J1erMC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WVLDn7J1erMC,5.0,1.0,Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics,,

Necessary Losses,['Judith Viorst'],Simon and Schuster,2010-05-08,"The classic New York Times bestseller about the many forms of loss we experience throughout our lives, and the necessity of letting go. In Necessary Losses, Judith Viorst turns her considerable talents to a serious and far-reaching subject: how we grow and change through the losses that are a certain and necessary part of life. She argues persuasively that through the loss of our mothers’ protection, the loss of the impossible expectations we bring to relationships, the loss of our younger selves, and the loss of our loved ones through separation and death, we gain deeper perspective, true maturity, and fuller wisdom about life. She has written a book that is both life-affirming and life-changing. Drawing on psychoanalysis, literature, and personal experience, Necessary Losses is a philosophy for understanding and accepting a universal human experience. “One of the most sensitive and comprehensive books about the human condition I have read in a long time.” —Harold S.

Ya-Yas in Bloom,['Rebecca Wells'],Harper Collins,2009-03-17,"Rebecca Wells's wonderful third book in her Ya-Ya trilogy, which includes Little Altars Everywhere and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, is sure to provide reading that makes you laugh and cry, a book that will break your heart and mend it again. Ya-Yas in Bloom reveals the roots of the Ya-Yas' friendship in the 1930s, following Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Necie through sixty years of marriage, child-raising, and hair-raising family secrets. When four-year-old Teensy Whitman prisses one time too many and stuffs a big old pecan up her nose, she sets off the chain of events that lead Vivi, Teensy, Caro, and Necie to become true sister-friends. Using as narration the alternating voices of Vivi and the Petite Ya-Yas, Siddalee and Baylor Walker, as well as other denizens of Thornton, Louisiana, Wells show us the Ya-Yas in love and at war with convention. Through crises of faith and hilarious lapses of parenting skills, brushes with alcoholism and glimpses of the dark reality of racial bigotry, the Ya-Ya values of unconditional loyalty, high style, and Louisiana sass shine through. But in the Ya-Yas' inimitable way, these four remarkable women also teach their children about the Mysteries: the wonder of snow in the deep South, the possibility that humans are made of stars, and the belief that miracles do happen. And they need a miracle when old grudges and wounded psyches lead to a heartbreaking crime...and the dynamic web of sisterhood is the only safety net strong enough to hold families together and endure. After two bestsellers and a blockbuster movie, the Ya-Yas have become part of American culture -- icons for the power of women's friendship. Ya-Yas in Bloom continues the saga, giving us more Ya-Ya lore, spun out in the rich patois of the Louisiana bayou country and brim full of the Ya-Ya message to embrace life and each other with joy.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061758843'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061758841'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",279.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.5.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O0GjOZRI3qsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O0GjOZRI3qsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=O0GjOZRI3qsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:YA-YAS+IN+BLOOM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O0GjOZRI3qsC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O0GjOZRI3qsC,,,A Novel,,

The Book of True Believer,['M. Funk'],Wild Abandon Books,2020-10-30,"Bronze Winner of the 2020 SPR Book Awards! “Life is a marvelous concoction of endings and beginnings laced up in ribbons of fantasy and fairy tale . . .” It’s been nearly three years since Pentecostal faith healer Jeremiah Promise and empathic, free-spirited True Believer first met—three years since he laid hands and miraculously cured her of terminal cancer. A lot has happened since then: Jeremiah’s former ministry partner has been imprisoned for fraud, Jeremiah’s reputation has been destroyed, and his faith in God and sense of moral idealism have been shattered. To imaginative and impressionable True, it's a matter of supreme destiny when Jeremiah shows up in her small town of Luck, WI for one final healing Crusade. True's absolute faith in Jeremiah inspires him to start fresh with a new ministry and a new partner (True) by his side. Doors miraculously open for them, and all seems right with the world as the two set out to construct a new faith-healing empire. Both of their lives are finally on the right path . . . or so True thinks. When Jeremiah's veneer of moral infallibility slowly rolls back to reveal inconsistencies beneath, True discovers that she may have a difficult decision to make between love and integrity.

Until I Find You,['Rachel Nolan'],Harvard University Press,2024-01-09,"The poignant saga of Guatemala’s adoption industry: an international marketplace for children, built on a foundation of inequality, war, and Indigenous dispossession. In 2009 Dolores Preat went to a small Maya town in Guatemala to find her birth mother. At the address retrieved from her adoption file, she was told that her supposed mother, one Rosario Colop Chim, never gave up a child for adoption—but in 1984 a girl across the street was abducted. At that house, Preat met a woman who strongly resembled her. Colop Chim, it turned out, was not Preat’s mother at all, but a jaladora—a baby broker. Some 40,000 children, many Indigenous, were kidnapped or otherwise coercively parted from families scarred by Guatemala’s civil war or made desperate by unrelenting poverty. Amid the US-backed army’s genocide against Indigenous Maya, children were wrested from their villages and put up for adoption illegally, mostly in the United States. During the war’s second decade, adoption was privatized, overseen by lawyers who made good money matching children to overseas families. Private adoptions skyrocketed to the point where tiny Guatemala overtook giants like China and Russia as a “sender” state. Drawing on government archives, oral histories, and a rare cache of adoption files opened briefly for war crimes investigations, Rachel Nolan explores the human toll of an international industry that thrives on exploitation. Would-be parents in rich countries have fostered a commercial market for children from poor countries, with Guatemala becoming the most extreme case. Until I Find You reckons with the hard truths of a practice that builds loving families in the Global North out of economic exploitation, endemic violence, and dislocation in the Global South.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780674294684'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0674294688'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",321.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IPviEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IPviEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IPviEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162&dq=intitle:UNTIL+I+FIND+YOU&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IPviEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IPviEAAAQBAJ,,,Disappeared Children and Coercive Adoptions in Guatemala,,

Chill Factor,"['David Paitson', 'Craig Merz']",Simon and Schuster,2015-03-03,"The city of Columbus, Ohio, had always struggled to support any professional sports franchise. It’s a town where Ohio State University reigns supreme, and everything else is less important. That was until 1991, when the Columbus Chill, a minor-league hockey franchise, arrived. Using Veeckian marketing tactics and on-ice shenanigans, the Chill became the talk of the city and gained a religious local fan base. Based on the success of the Chill, from 1991–99, the city of Columbus was awarded with the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2000, the city’s own NHL franchise. Chill Factor follows the wild ride through the eyes of team president and general manager David Paitson, from the early formation of the minor-league franchise through the decision to rattle the status quo by going to the edge and beyond with a marketing and promotional plan that was both edgy and controversial. The success of the Chill after their first season gave the organization the impetus to challenge local civic and business leaders to build a world-class arena and emerge from the shadow of OSU. There were setbacks and triumphs on and off the ice, and eventually the realization that the Columbus of today would not be possible without the aid of the Chill. Chill Factor takes readers into the front office and onto the rink, giving every angle of how a small town was able to get behind a working-class team that fought both on and off the ice. This thrilling account will appeal to those who remember the Chill’s reign, as well as those who enjoy seeing the underdog climb the ladder to sports supremacy.

Sometimes it's even about justice. A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney's dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career. Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal -- this time to save his own life.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780759514713'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0759514712'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",416.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.16.18.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xc01AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xc01AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xc01AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+LINCOLN+LAWYER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xc01AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xc01AQAAQBAJ,,,,,

A Feast for Crows,['George R. R. Martin'],Bantam,2005-11-08,"THE BOOK BEHIND THE FOURTH SEASON OF THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction. A FEAST FOR CROWS It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780553900323'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0553900323'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",786.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.33.29.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NuMx6tmf5iIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NuMx6tmf5iIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NuMx6tmf5iIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+FEAST+FOR+CROWS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NuMx6tmf5iIC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NuMx6tmf5iIC,3.5,180.0,A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four,,

World at Risk,['Ulrich Beck'],John Wiley & Sons,2013-10-29,"Twenty years ago Ulrich Beck published Risk Society, a book that called our attention to the dangers of environmental catastrophes and changed the way we think about contemporary societies. During the last two decades, the dangers highlighted by Beck have taken on new forms and assumed ever greater significance. Terrorism has shifted to a global arena, financial crises have produced worldwide consequences that are difficult to control and politicians have been forced to accept that climate change is not idle speculation. In short, we have come to see that today we live in a world at risk. A new feature of our world risk society is that risk is produced for political gain. This political use of risk means that fear creeps into modern life. A need for security encroaches on our liberty and our view of equality. However, Beck is anything but an alarmist and believes that the anticipation of catastrophe can fundamentally change global politics. We have the opportunity today to reconfigure power in terms of what Beck calls a 'cosmopolitan material politics’. World at Risk is a timely and far-reaching analysis of the structural dynamics of the modern world, the global nature of risk and the future of global politics by one of the most original and exciting social thinkers writing today.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780745681627'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '074568162X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",240.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UUjjAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UUjjAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UUjjAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:AT+RISK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UUjjAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UUjjAQAAQBAJ,,,,,

Twelve Sharp,['Janet Evanovich'],Hachette UK,2011-10-13,"Sometimes marriage can be a killer... Usually hot on the heels of various miscreants, bounty hunter Stephanie Plum finds herself with a suspicious stalker in Twelve Sharp, the wildest novel yet in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Not to be missed by fans of Lee Child and JD Robb. Praise for Evanovich: 'Evanovich is a clever writer with a strong streak of laugh out loud sardonic humour' (Melbourne Weekly); 'Non-stop laughs with plenty of high jinks' (USA Today); 'As smart and sassy as high gloss wet paint' (Time Out). Just when it seems Stephanie Plum's life may be calming down, a new threat turns up: the wife of her mentor Ranger. Only it seems this wife isn't everything she says, and with Plum's usual protector in danger, Stephanie might actually have to look after Ranger for once. Problem is Stephanie's on-again-off-again boyfriend, and Trenton cop, Joe Morelli already isn't too pleased with how close Stephanie is becoming to Ranger. Not only is Ranger temptation walking, he also has a long list of psychopaths and trained killers after him that make Stephanie's list of nut jobs seem normal... What readers are saying about Twelve Sharp: 'Immensely good fun - Evanovich knows how to write them light and frivolous' 'The suspense and action will have you panting until the very end. The storyline is one of the best, filled with the action and suspense yet perfectly paired with comic relief' 'There is something for everyone - adventure, action, romance, comedy and sex'","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780755388486'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0755388488'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",207.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.17.16.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0k5KhFDla3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0k5KhFDla3gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0k5KhFDla3gC&pg=PT7&dq=intitle:TWELVE+SHARP&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0k5KhFDla3gC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0k5KhFDla3gC,,,"A hilarious mystery full of temptation, suspense and chaos",,

The Judge in a Democracy,['Aharon Barak'],Princeton University Press,2009-01-10,"Whether examining election outcomes, the legal status of terrorism suspects, or if (or how) people can be sentenced to death, a judge in a modern democracy assumes a role that raises some of the most contentious political issues of our day. But do judges even have a role beyond deciding the disputes before them under law? What are the criteria for judging the justices who write opinions for the United States Supreme Court or constitutional courts in other democracies? These are the questions that one of the world's foremost judges and legal theorists, Aharon Barak, poses in this book. In fluent prose, Barak sets forth a powerful vision of the role of the judge. He argues that this role comprises two central elements beyond dispute resolution: bridging the gap between the law and society, and protecting the constitution and democracy. The former involves balancing the need to adapt the law to social change against the need for stability; the latter, judges' ultimate accountability, not to public opinion or to politicians, but to the ""internal morality"" of democracy. Barak's vigorous support of ""purposive interpretation"" (interpreting legal texts--for example, statutes and constitutions--in light of their purpose) contrasts sharply with the influential ""originalism"" advocated by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. As he explores these questions, Barak also traces how supreme courts in major democracies have evolved since World War II, and he guides us through many of his own decisions to show how he has tried to put these principles into action, even under the burden of judging on terrorism.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781400827046'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1400827043'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",355.0,BOOK,['Law'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.2.4.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9dVYGvTHm38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9dVYGvTHm38C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9dVYGvTHm38C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:JUDGE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9dVYGvTHm38C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9dVYGvTHm38C,,,,,
De crisis van het democratisch kapitalisme,['Martin Wolf'],Spectrum,2023-03-10,"Krachtig pleidooi voor de instandhouding van het democratisch kapitalisme Toen de Berlijnse Muur in 1989 viel, zegevierde het westerse democratisch kapitalisme. Democratie en kapitalisme verspreidden zich in rap tempo over de hele wereld en onder de bevolking overheerste een gevoel van triomf. Nu, meer dan een kwarteeuw later, wordt de westerse wereld geconfronteerd met een financiële crisis, heerst er een groeiende ongelijkheid en is de onvrede groot. Er gaan krachtige stemmen op dat het kapitalisme beter af zou zijn zonder democratie, terwijl anderen juist het tegendeel beweren. In De crisis van het democratisch kapitalisme geeft Martin Wolf een overtuigend weerwoord op beide standpunten. Hij biedt een diepgaande en heldere visie op het steeds wankelere huwelijk tussen kapitalisme en democratie – en maakt duidelijk waarom een scheiding een vrijwel onoverkomelijke ramp zou zijn. Martin Wolf is Chief Economics Commentator van de Financial Times. Hij heeft een eredoctoraat aan de London School of Economics, is Honorary Fellow aan Nuffield College in Oxford en is lid van de International Media Council van het World Economic Forum. Voor zijn werk ontving hij meerdere prijzen.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789000355792'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9000355796'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",610.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LPayEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LPayEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LPayEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CRISIS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LPayEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LPayEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

So he chooses his father, only to see him disappear when Charley is on the verge of adolescence. Decades later, Charley is a broken man. His life has been destroyed by alcohol and regret. He loses his job. He leaves his family. When he discovers that he won't be invited to his only daughter's wedding he realises he has hit rock bottom. Charley makes a midnight ride to his small hometown; his final journey before he ends his life. But as he staggers into his old house, he makes an astonishing discovery. His mother - who died eight years earlier - is there to welcome Charley home. What follows is the one seemingly ordinary day so many of us yearn for: a chance to reconcile with someone lost to us, to understand family secrets and to seek forgiveness from a person we love. __________ WHAT READERS SAY ABOUT FOR ONE MORE DAY 'Superb read, Mitch Albom has a way of writing to reach the soul of the reader' 'Ground-breaking . . .

Thirteen Moons,['Charles Frazier'],Hachette UK,2013-09-12,"At the age of twelve, under the Wind Moon, Will is given a horse, a key, and a map, and sent alone into the Indian Nation to run a trading post as a bound boy. It is during this time that he grows into a man, learning, as he does, of the raw power it takes to create a life, to find a home. In a card game with a white Indian named Featherstone, Will wins - for a brief moment - a mysterious girl named Claire, and his passion and desire for her spans this novel. As Will's destiny intertwines with the fate of the Cherokee Indians, including a Cherokee Chief named Bear, he learns how to fight and survive in the face of both nature and men, and eventually, under the Corn Tassle Moon, Will begins the fight against Washington City to preserve the Cherokee's homeland and culture. And he will come to know the truth behind his belief that 'only desire trumps time'.

The Humanitarians,['David P. Forsythe'],Cambridge University Press,2005-08-11,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) coordinates the world's largest private relief system for conflict situations. Its staff operates throughout the world, and in recent years the ICRC has mounted large operations in the Balkans and Somalia. Yet despite its very important role its internal workings are mysterious and often secretive. This book examines the ICRC from its origins in the mid-nineteenth century up to the present day, and provides a comprehensive overview of a unique private organisation, whose governing body remains all-Swiss, but which is recognized in international law as if it were an inter-governmental organization. David Forsythe focuses on the policy making and field work of the ICRC, while not ignoring international humanitarian law. He explores how it exercises its independence, impartiality, and neutrality to try to protect prisoners in Iraq, displaced and starving civilians in Somalia, and families separated by conflict in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. David Forsythe received the Distinguished Scholar Award for 2007 from the Human Rights Section of the American Political Science Association.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1139446320'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781139446327'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",384.0,BOOK,['Political Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.6.8.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cen4kujyjtYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cen4kujyjtYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cen4kujyjtYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CROSS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cen4kujyjtYC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cen4kujyjtYC,,,The International Committee of the Red Cross,,
Six Memos for the Next Millennium,['Italo Calvino'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2016-08-02,"The celebrated author of Cosmicomics and Invisible Cities shares his “brilliant, original approach to literature” in these late-career lectures (San Francisco Chronicle). At the time of his death, Italo Calvino was at work on his Charles Eliot Norton poetry lectures to be delivered the following year at Harvard University. The six planned lectures would define the qualities he most valued in writing, and which he believed would define literature in the century to come. Six Memos for the Next Millennium collects the five lectures he completed, forming not only a stirring defense of literature, but also an indispensable guide to the writings of Calvino himself. He devotes one “memo” each to the concepts of lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity, drawing examples from his vast knowledge of myth, folklore, and works both ancient and modern. Written in the mid-1980s, these lectures have proven to be astonishingly prescient as we have entered Calvino’s “next millennium”. “One of the most rigorously presented and beautifully illustrated critical testaments in all of literature.”—Boston Globe “A key to Calvino’s own work and a thoroughly delightful and illuminating commentary on some of the world’s greatest writing.”—San Francisco Chronicle","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780544230965'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0544230965'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",134.0,BOOK,['Literary Collections'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7rPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7rPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7rPqDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NEXT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7rPqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7rPqDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

THE MISSION: Fearing a German victory in WWI, the Romanian government signed a deal with Russia to protect the country’s treasures. In 1916, two trains full of gold and the most precious possessions of the Romanian state—paintings, jewelry, and ancient artifacts—were sent to the underground vaults of the Kremlin. But in the turmoil of war, the Romanian treasure was scattered and lost. THE PRIZE: The collection is now valued at over $3.5 billion.

The Alexandria Link,['Steve Berry'],Ballantine Books,2007-02-06,"Cotton Malone retired from the high-risk world of elite operatives for the U.S. Justice Department to lead the low-key life of a rare-book dealer. But his quiet existence is shattered when he receives an anonymous e-mail: “You have something I want. You’ re the only person on earth who knows where to find it. Go get it. You have 72 hours. If I don’t hear from you, you will be childless.” His horrified ex-wife confirms that the threat is real: Their teenage son has been kidnapped. When Malone’s Copenhagen bookshop is burned to the ground, it becomes brutally clear that those responsible will stop at nothing to get what they want. And what they want is nothing less than the lost Library of Alexandria. A cradle of ideas–historical, philosophical, literary, scientific, and religious–the Library of Alexandria was unparalleled in the world. But fifteen hundred years ago, it vanished into the mists of myth and legend–its vast bounty of wisdom coveted ever since by scholars, fortune hunters, and those who believe its untold secrets hold the key to ultimate power. Now a cartel of wealthy international moguls, bent on altering the course of history, is desperate to breach the library’s hallowed halls–and only Malone possesses the information they need to succeed. At stake is an explosive ancient document with the potential not only to change the destiny of the Middle East but to shake the world’s three major religions to their very foundations. Pursued by a lethal mercenary, Malone crosses the globe in search of answers. His quest will lead him to England and Portugal, even to the highest levels of American government–and the shattering outcome, deep in the Sinai desert, will have worldwide repercussions. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Steve Berry’s The Columbus Affair and a Cotton Malone dossier.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345497123'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345497120'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",450.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.9.10.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=usU2-yyHqSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=usU2-yyHqSEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=usU2-yyHqSEC&pg=PT32&dq=intitle:THE+ALEXANDRIA+LINK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=usU2-yyHqSEC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=usU2-yyHqSEC,3.0,1.0,,,

Natural Born Charmer,['Susan Elizabeth Phillips'],Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"Chicago Stars quarterback Dean Robillard is the luckiest man in the world: a bona-fide sports superstar and the pride of the NFL with a profitable side career as a buff billboard model for End Zone underwear. But life in the glory lane has started to pale, and Dean has set off on a cross-country trip to figure out what's gone wrong. When he hits a lonely stretch of Colorado highway, he spies something that will shake up his gilded life in ways he can't imagine. A young woman . . . dressed in a beaver suit. Blue Bailey is on a mission to murder her ex. Or at least inflict serious damage. As for the beaver suit she's wearing . . . Is it her fault that life keeps throwing her curveballs? Witness the expensive black sports car pulling up next to her on the highway and the Greek god stepping out of it. Blue's career as a portrait painter is the perfect job for someone who refuses to stay in one place for very long. She needs a ride, and America's most famous football player has an imposing set of wheels. Now, all she has to do is keep him entertained, off guard, and fully clothed before he figures out exactly how desperate she is. But Dean isn't the brainless jock she imagines, and Blue—despite her petite stature—is just about the toughest woman Dean has ever met. They're soon heading for his summer home where their already complicated lives and inconvenient attraction to each other will become entangled with a charismatic but aging rock star; a beautiful fifty-two-year-old woman trying to make peace with her rock and roll past; an eleven-year-old who desperately needs a family; and a bitter old woman who hates them all. As the summer progresses, the wandering portrait artist and the charming football star play a high-stakes game, fighting themselves and each other for a chance to have it all. Natural Born Charmer is for everyone who's ever thought about leaving their old life in the dust and never looking back.

Eve Dallas doesn’t like to see innocent people murdered. And the death of history teacher Craig Foster is clearly a murder case. The lunch that his wife lovingly packed was tainted with deadly ricin. And Mr. Foster’s colleagues, shocked as they may be, have some shocking secrets of their own. It’s Eve’s job to get a feel for all the potential suspects—and find out why someone would have done this to a man who seemed so inoffensive, so pleasant...so innocent. Someone Eve could easily picture dead is an old flame of her billionaire husband Roarke, who has turned up in New York and manipulated herself back into his life. Consumed by her jealousy—and Roarke’s indifference to it—Eve finds it hard to focus on the Foster case.

Daddy's Girl,['Charlotte Vale-Allen'],Island Nation Press LLC,2002,"On Writing Daddy's GirlAfter I had been through many versions of the manuscript (written over almost a decade) I decided that for this book to have validity it would be necessary not only to show the past but also to give a picture of the present-illustrating how the events of my childhood affected me at the time, as well as later in life as an adult and a parent.Given that I wrote the book in the first place as a document that I hoped would be useful to others who'd suffered abuse and also to professionals, I felt it was very important to present detailed portraits of the child I was and the woman I grew to be (in large measure as a result of trying to cope with the long-term effects of the abuse.) As well, I thought it was vital to illustrate how fallout from the abuse can be felt down through the generations, if one fails to exercise awareness and caution.So the book weaves back and forth between past and present (the present being 1979, when the final version was completed). I also had to decide at the very start whether I was going to dole out snippets of truth or be completely truthful and address the issue as fully as I was able. There seemed no point to writing an autobiographical account of incest if I was going to be anything less than completely truthful. It was not difficult to tell the truth, nor was the writing of the book a cathartic experience, as many have imagined it to be. The fact is that I had long-since confronted my personal demons and had managed to relegate the past to the past-something exceedingly difficult for many victims of any/all forms of abuse to do.A few years ago in correcting the page proofs of a new British edition of the book, I reread DADDY'S GIRL, and was gratified by what I'd written. (Often, with my novels, I am not at all happy when I reread them.) I think that as an author I have little, if any, objectivity about my work once it's completed and so am not necessarily a good judge of it. But I am proud of DADDY'S GIRL. Since its publication in 1980 it has been of help to a lot of people. And, ultimately, it's my way of returning some measure of the kindness and attention people showed me when I was working my way along the rough roadway toward my future.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781892738349'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1892738341'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",112.0,BOOK,['Incest'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.3.2.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8VwMgjpCPUcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8VwMgjpCPUcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8VwMgjpCPUcC&pg=PA18&dq=intitle:DADDY%E2%80%99S+GIRL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=8VwMgjpCPUcC&dq=intitle:DADDY%E2%80%99S+GIRL&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Daddy_s_Girl.html?hl=&id=8VwMgjpCPUcC,,,,,

The Yiddish Policemen's Union,['Michael Chabon'],Harper Collins,2012-01-24,"For sixty years Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a ""temporary"" safe haven created in the wake of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062124586'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062124587'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",464.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.12.10.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+YIDDISH+POLICEMEN%E2%80%99S+UNION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiKNDnFagiAC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiKNDnFagiAC,,,A Novel,,

High Noon,['Phillip Drummond'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-07-25,"Made in 1951, High Noon rapidly became one of the most celebrated and controversial Hollywood dramas of the post-war period. A grave, taut western about community and violence, High Noon collected a clutch of Oscars, helped to re-establish the dwindling fortunes of its star, Gary Cooper, and confirmed the stature of director Fred Zinnemann and producer Stanley Kramer. The film was also a flashpoint for the conflict between the US film industry and McCarthyite anti-communism: writer and associate producer Carl Foreman was hounded off the production and blacklisted. Phillip Drummond offers a detailed account of High Noon's troubled production context and its early public reception, along with career-summaries of the key participants. He analyzes the dramatic organization of the film with close reference to the original short story and Carl Foreman's script, and concludes with an invaluable overview of the long history of critical debates, focusing on questions of social identity and gender. The result is a fresh and nuanced reading of a major classic. Phillip Drummond is Lecturer in Film and Media Studies at the Institute of Education, University of London, UK.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781838716110'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1838716114'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",129.0,BOOK,['Performing Arts'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZAn8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZAn8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZAn8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:HIGH+NOON&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZAn8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZAn8DwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Play Dirty,['Sandra Brown'],Pocket Books,2019-09-24,"The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Seeing Red delivers a gripping story of obsession and its deadly consequences—where nobody’s playing by the rules. After five long years in federal prison, Griff Burkett is a free man. But the disgraced quarterback can never return to life as he knew it before he was caught cheating. In a place where football is practically a religion, Griff committed a cardinal sin, and no one is forgiving. Foster Speakman, owner and CEO of SunSouth Airlines, and his wife, Laura, are a golden couple. Successful and wealthy, they lived a charmed life before fate cruelly intervened and denied them the one thing they wanted most—a child. It’s said that money can’t buy everything. But it can buy a disgraced football player fresh out of prison and out of prospects. The job Griff agrees to do for the Speakmans demands secrecy. But he soon finds himself once again in the spotlight of suspicion. An unsolved murder comes back to haunt him in the form of his nemesis, Stanley Rodarte, who has made Griff's destruction his life’s mission. While safeguarding his new enterprise, Griff must also protect those around him, especially Laura Speakman, from Rodarte’s ruthlessness. Griff stands to gain the highest payoff he could ever imagine, but cashing in on it will require him to forfeit his only chance for redemption...and love. Griff is now playing a high-stakes game, and at the final whistle, one player will be dead. Play Dirty is a wild ride, with hairpin turns all along the way. The clock is ticking down on a fallen football star, who lost everything because of the way he played the game.

When her elderly neighbour Gus has an accident, Kinsey Millhone is relieved when his niece organizes a nurse for him. Verifying a background check on Solana Rojas doesn’t turn up anything suspicious. But Kinsey’s not convinced – especially when Gus seems to be getting worse under his nurse’s tender care. Realizing that her neighbourly concern isn’t going to get her past the front door Kinsey turns to more unorthodox methods to step up her investigation. And gets far more than she bargained for . . . Not only is Solana not who she seems to be but she’s more than able to play Kinsey at her own game. Suddenly the tables have turned and it’s Kinsey who’s on the wrong side of the law . . .","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780230714762'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0230714765'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",496.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.7.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G4aInE0TAxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G4aInE0TAxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=G4aInE0TAxMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:%E2%80%9CT%E2%80%9D+IS+FOR+TRESPASS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G4aInE0TAxMC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G4aInE0TAxMC,,,,,

Stephanie Plum has a way of attracting danger, lunatics, oddballs, bad luck . . . and mystery men. And no one is more mysterious than the unmentionable Diesel. He's back and hot on the trail of a little man in green pants who's lost a giant bag of money. Problem is, the money isn't exactly lost.

Muhammad and the People of the Book,['Sahaja Carimokam'],Xlibris Corporation,2010-09-17,"Muhammad and the People of Book by Sahaja Carimokam asks the question, what was the nature of Muhammad’s relationship to non-Muslims, particularly Jews and Christians, and how did it change over time? This work is based on a chronological reading of the chapters of the Qur’an supplemented with Muslim commentary literature and biographical materials on the life of Muhammad. Carimokam traces Muhammad’s evolving religious viewpoint based on his borrowings of primarily Jewish and some Christian traditional/apocryphal materials. He shows how Muhammad’s inaccurate and anachronistic rendition of Jewish traditional literature ensured that the Jews would reject him as a Prophet. This rejection lead to his ultimatum to the Jews early in the Medinan period of the Qur’an and culminated with his call to Jihad against all non-Muslims, including those Jews and Christians who refused to acknowledge his Prophethood. The origins of takfir, declaring Muslims to be non-Muslims, are considered. Comparisons are made of moderate and traditional interpreters of the Qur’an. Historical-critical issues regarding the background provided by Muslim historical propaganda is considered in one chapter. The book concludes with a controversial issue for the interpretation of Islamic law in the 21st century based on the actual canonical practices of Muhammad.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781453537855'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1453537856'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",568.0,BOOK,['Religion'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.1.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOZZCcXbc5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EOZZCcXbc5QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=EOZZCcXbc5QC&pg=PA171&dq=intitle:PEOPLE+OF+THE+BOOK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EOZZCcXbc5QC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EOZZCcXbc5QC,,,,,

The Fairway Players, a local theatre group, is in the midst of rehearsals when tragedy strikes the family of director Martin Hayward and his wife Helen, the play’s star. Their young granddaughter has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, and with an experimental treatment costing a tremendous sum, their castmates rally to raise the money to give her a chance at survival. But not everybody is convinced of the experimental treatment’s efficacy—nor of the good intentions of those involved. As tension grows within the community, things come to a shocking head at the explosive dress rehearsal. The next day, a dead body is found, and soon, an arrest is made. In the run-up to the trial, two young lawyers sift through the material—emails, messages, letters—with a growing suspicion that the killer may be hiding in plain sight. The evidence is all there, between the lines, waiting to be uncovered.

Ellen and Andy's first year of marriage doesn't just seem perfect, it is perfect. There is no question how deep their devotion is, and how naturally they bring out the best in each other. But one fateful afternoon, Ellen runs into Leo for the first time in eight years. Leo, the one who brought out the worst in her. Leo, the one who left her heartbroken with no explanation.

The Hanoverian dynasty that came to power with the accession of George I in 1714 inherited the largest navy in the world. In the course of the century, this force would see a vast amount of action against nearly every major navy, reaching a pinnacle of success in the Seven Years War only to taste defeat in the American Revolution. This superb reference book outlines the service history of every ship that fought for the Royal Navy in the great wars of the eighteenth century—well over 2000 vessels. The book is organized by Rate, classification and class. The technical and building data of each ship is followed by a concise summary of its career. This includes commissioning dates, refit periods, changes of captain, the stations where they served, and details of any noteworthy actions in which they took part. It will enable anyone to follow up a casual reference to any warship, and will provide the researcher with a solid core of information on which to base further study.

East Asia Before the West,['David Kang'],Columbia University Press,2012,"From the founding of the Ming dynasty in 1368 to the start of the Opium Wars in 1841, China has engaged in only two large-scale conflicts with its principal neighbors, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. These four territorial and centralized states have otherwise fostered peaceful and long-lasting relationships with one another, and as they have grown more powerful, the atmosphere around them has stabilized. Focusing on the role of the ""tribute system"" in maintaining stability in East Asia and fostering diplomatic and commercial exchange, Kang contrasts this history against the example of Europe and the East Asian states' skirmishes with nomadic peoples to the north and west. Scholars tend to view Europe's experience as universal, but Kang upends this tradition, emphasizing East Asia's formal hierarchy as an international system with its own history and character. His approach not only recasts common understandings of East Asian relations but also defines a model that applies to other hegemonies outside of the European order.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780231153195'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0231153198'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",240.0,BOOK,['East Asia'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.0.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jgk0buCaLJ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jgk0buCaLJ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jgk0buCaLJ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TRIBUTE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Jgk0buCaLJ0C&dq=intitle:TRIBUTE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/East_Asia_Before_the_West.html?hl=&id=Jgk0buCaLJ0C,,,Five Centuries of Trade and Tribute,,
The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,['David Wroblewski'],Harper Collins,2009-10-13,"Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm—and into Edgar's mother's affections. Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires—spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward. David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes—the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain—create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061792595'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061792594'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",608.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.7.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CAxtwAyUlYQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CAxtwAyUlYQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CAxtwAyUlYQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+STORY+OF+EDGAR+SAWTELLE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CAxtwAyUlYQC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CAxtwAyUlYQC,3.0,91.0,A Novel,,

Maar zolang niemand zich meldt, houdt hij de foto bij zich. Na een tijdje begint het Logan op te vallen dat hij meer geluk heeft dan anders: hij wint het ene na het andere spelletje poker, en bij een hevig gevecht komen twee collega’s om, maar blijft hij gespaard.

When an act of sabotage aims to slow down a technological breakthrough in American clean energy, it puts the United States on the brink of war with one of its closest allies. Tension boils on the homefront, too, as gas prices surge to an all-time high.

De Scarpetta factor,['Patricia Cornwell'],Luitingh Sijthoff,2016-02-03,"Scarpetta en haar nicht Lucy raken in Patricia Cornwells zeventiende Kay Scarpetta-thriller verwikkeld in een dodelijk complot... De Scarpetta factor is het zeventiende boek uit de bloedstollende bestsellerserie rond patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta van auteur Patricia Cornwell. Deze serie betekende Patricia Cornwells doorbraak als grondlegger van de pathologisch-anatomische thriller. Het is de week voor kerst en Kay Scarpetta heeft een pro-bonozaak aangenomen in New York. In geen tijd lijkt haar toegenomen bekendheid een serie van dramatische en verontrustende misdaden te veroorzaken. Omwille van deze groeiende bekendheid wordt Kay uitgenodigd om op televisie te komen praten over de sensationele verdwijning van Hannah Starr. Tijdens de uitzending ontvangt Kay een verontrustende oproep van een voormalig psychiatrisch patiënt. Wanneer Kay die avond thuiskomt, ligt er een mysterieus pakketje in het appartement, waar ze samen met Benton woont, op haar te wachten. Wat zit er in het pakketje? Een bom? Al snel raakt Scarpetta verwikkeld in een dodelijk complot – een complot waarbij een beroemde acteur beschuldigd wordt van seksueel misbruik en een mooie, rijke vrouw verdwijnt. En wat gebeurt er wanneer Lucy, Scarpetta’s nicht, een geheim verleden lijkt te hebben met deze puissante vrouw? Patricia Cornwells werk over de vrouwelijke patholoog-anatoom Scarpetta is de bestverkochte thrillerserie ter wereld. De serie werd bekroond met de Edgar Award en de Gold Dagger.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789021804392'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9021804395'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",432.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMYvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BMYvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BMYvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SCARPETTA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BMYvAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BMYvAgAAQBAJ,,,,,

Plum Spooky,['Janet Evanovich'],St. Martin's Press,2009-01-06,"Plum Spooky, the First Full Length Stephanie Plum Between-the-Numbers Novel from #1 Bestselling Author Janet Evanovich. Turn on all the lights and check under your bed. Things are about to get spooky in Trenton, New Jersey. According to legend, the Jersey Devil prowls the Pine Barrens and soars above the treetops in the dark of night. As eerie as this might seem, there are things in the Barrens that are even more frightening and dangerous. And there are monkeys. Lots of monkeys. Wulf Grimoire is a world wanderer and an opportunist who can kill without remorse and disappear like smoke. He's chosen Martin Munch, boy genius, as his new business partner, and he's chosen the Barrens as his new playground. Munch received his doctorate degree in quantum physics when he was twenty-two. He's now twenty-four, and while his brain is large, his body hasn't made it out of the boys' department at Macy's. Anyone who says good things come in small packages hasn't met Munch. Wulf Grimoire is looking for world domination. Martin Munch would be happy if he could just get a woman naked and tied to a tree. Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has Munch on her most-wanted list for failure to appear in court. Plum is the all-American girl stuck in an uncomfortable job, succeeding on luck and tenacity. Usually she gets her man. This time she gets a monkey. She also gets a big guy named Diesel. Diesel pops in and out of Plum's life like birthday cake – delicious to look at and taste, not especially healthy as a steady diet, gone by the end of the week if not sooner. He's an über bounty hunter with special skills when it comes to tracking men and pleasing women. He's after Grimoire, and now he's also after Munch. And if truth were told, he wouldn't mind setting Stephanie Plum in his crosshairs. Diesel and Plum hunt down Munch and Grimoire, following them into the Barrens, surviving cranberry bogs, the Jersey Devil, a hair-raising experience, sand in their underwear, and, of course . . . monkeys.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429990882'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429990880'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",356.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.10.13.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ALvS8AzgTAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ALvS8AzgTAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_ALvS8AzgTAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:PLUM+SPOOKY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ALvS8AzgTAC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_ALvS8AzgTAC,4.5,15.0,A Stephanie Plum Between the Numbers Novel,,

When reporter Ellen Gleeson gets a ""Have You Seen This Child?"" flyer in the mail, she almost throws it away. But something about it makes her look again, and her heart stops—the child in the photo is identical to her adopted son, Will. Her every instinct tells her to deny the similarity between the boys, because she knows her adoption was lawful. But she's a journalist and won't be able to stop thinking about the photo until she figures out the truth. And she can't shake the question: if Will rightfully belongs to someone else, should she keep him or give him up? She investigates, uncovering clues no one was meant to discover, and when she digs too deep, she risks losing her own life—and that of the son she loves.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429991612'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429991615'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",411.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.9.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sjQEUFzH8lcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sjQEUFzH8lcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sjQEUFzH8lcC&pg=PA2&dq=intitle:LOOK+AGAIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sjQEUFzH8lcC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sjQEUFzH8lcC,4.5,3.0,A Novel,,

Gone Tomorrow,['Gary Indiana'],Seven Stories Press,2018-09-18,"Footloose and broke, the unnamed narrator of Gone Tomorrow hops on a plane without asking questions when his director friend offers him a role in an art film set in Colombia. But from the moment he arrives at the airport in Bogotá, only to witness a policeman beat a beggar half to death, it becomes clear that this will not be the story of gritty bohemians triumphing against the odds. The director, Paul Grosvenor, seems more interested in manipulating his cast than in shooting film. The cult star, Irma Irma, is a vamp too bored and boring to draw blood. And the beautiful, nymph-like Michael Simard doesn’t seem to be putting out. Meanwhile, the film’s shady financier is sleeping with his mother, while a serial killer skulks about the area killing tourists. Everything comes to a head when the carnaval celebration begins in nearby Cali. But once the fiesta is over, all that’s left are ghostly memories and the narrator’s insistence on telling the tale. “Unlike the majority of pointedly AIDS-era novels,” writes Dennis Cooper, “Gone Tomorrow is neither an amoral nostalgia fest nor a thinly veiled wake-up call hyping the religion of sobriety. It’s a philosophical work devised by a writer who’s both too intelligent to buy into the notion that a successful future requires the compromise of collective decision and too moral to accept bitterness as the consequence of an adventurous life.”","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781609808648'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1609808649'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",240.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsFQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsFQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=NsFQDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:GONE+TOMORROW&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NsFQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NsFQDwAAQBAJ,,,A novel,,

De blik van Medusa,['Natalie Haynes'],J.M. Meulenhoff,2023-02-20,"‘De blik van Medusa versteent niet, integendeel, het verhaal is warm en teder en vergevensgezind. En niet te vergeten, erg geestig.’**** De Limburger ‘Deze spannende, zeer levendige en scherp geschreven roman werpt een verzachtend licht op Medusa.’ Zin Magazine ‘De blik van Haynes op Medusa is een nieuwe waarheid, die we niet meer kunnen én willen vergeten.’ Nederlands Dagblad ‘Wat Haynes in deze roman heel knap doet, is dat ze Medusa’s verhaal vanuit verschillende perspectieven belicht. Ze laat je als lezer beseffen: het maakt uit wie het verhaal vertelt, want het heeft verschillende kanten. Het drama rond Medusa zet ze spannend en ontroerend neer.’ Friesch Dagblad Een ontroerende en speelse hervertelling van het verhaal van Medusa Natalie Haynes heeft als missie om nieuw licht te werpen op vrouwelijke personages in Griekse mythen Medusa is de enige sterfelijke dochter in een familie van Gorgonen. Terwijl ze opgroeit met haar twee zussen beseft ze al snel dat zij de enige van het gezin is die ouder wordt, verandering ondergaat en kwetsbaar is. Wanneer de god en heerser van de zee, Poseidon, in Athenes heilige tempel een onvergeeflijke misdaad begaat, neemt de godin wraak op een onschuldige: Medusa. Haar leven zal nooit meer hetzelfde zijn. Verbijsterd ziet ze dat haar prachtige krullen vervangen zijn door slangen en merkt ze dat haar blik elk levend wezen in steen verandert. Medusa kan nooit meer naar haar geliefden kijken zonder ze te doden. Ze is gedoemd tot een leven in het halfduister, totdat Perseus aan zijn queeste begint om het hoofd van een van de Gorgonen te pakken te krijgen. De blik van Medusa is het door vele stemmen vertelde verhaal over een jonge vrouw die een monster werd. En over de vraag of ze ooit wel echt een monster is geweest. In de pers ‘Haynes bundelt in De blik van Medusa al haar kennis van de klassieken, en is daarbij heel, heel grappig.’ The Guardian ‘Geestig, aangrijpend, genadeloos.’ @MargaretAtwood, via Twitter ‘Mooi en ontroerend.’ @NeilGaiman, via Twitter ‘Haynes legt in haar scherpe en grappige analyses de motieven van de vrouwen voor hun gedrag bloot. Onmisbaar voor zowel ingewijden in de Griekse mythologie als lezers die kennis willen maken met de Griekse mythen.’ Het Parool over De kruik van Pandora","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789402321067'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9402321063'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",318.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.5.5.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-KaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-KaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=T-KaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MEDUSA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T-KaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T-KaEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

Gene Knockout Protocols,"['Martin J. Tymms', 'Ismail Kola']",Springer Science & Business Media,2008-02-03,"As the major task of sequencing the human genome is near completion and full complement of human genes are catalogued, attention will be focused on the ultimate goal: to understand the normal biological functions of these genes, and how alterations lead to disease states. In this task there is a severe limitation in working with human material, but the mouse has been adopted as the favored animal model because of the available genetic resources and the highly conserved gene conservation linkage organization. In just of ten years since the first gene-targeting experiments were p- formed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and mutations transmitted through the mouse germline, more than a thousand mouse strains have been created. These achievements have been made possible by pioneering work that showed that ES cells derived from preimplantation mouse embryos could be cultured for prolonged periods without differentiation in culture, and that homologous rec- bination between targeting constructs and endogenous DNA occurred at a f- quency sufficient for recombinants to be isolated. In the next few years the mouse genome will be systematically altered, and the techniques for achi- ing manipulations are constantly being streamlined and improved.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781592592203'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1592592201'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",434.0,BOOK,['Medical'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZpdJukfew0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZpdJukfew0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jZpdJukfew0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:KNOCKOUT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jZpdJukfew0C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jZpdJukfew0C,,,,,

Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths,['Aaron A. Andrews'],Black Star Media Group,2015-03-29,"Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths Are you tired of traditional self-help literature that always gives the same advice? Would you like to learn why the total opposite of self-help “truths” can actually work much better for you? If so, Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths is for you. The book presents 9 self-help myths and shows how the opposite advice can work better. A large part of the book is based on scientific research that proves beyond doubt that some self-help myths are indeed just dangerous myths. Let’s Put an End to Dangerous Self-Help Myths Some self-help myths are not only wrong, they are outright harmful for you. One of such myths is the myth of waking up early in order to achieve success and the myth that visualizing the goal will help you achieve it. In fact, scientists have proved that visualizing the goal will lead you further away from it. And as for waking up early, at least 20% of us will only feel miserable when following this advice. Here are other things you’ll learn from the book: - two types of procrastination and why one of them is great for you - why procrastination can help you evaluate your life choices - why procrastination can help you find a reason why - why hard work is stupid - the story of how ignorant farmers popularized the myth of working hard - three reasons why cutting down your hours will do you good - how to achieve more with less (hint: it’s not about working hard) - why sometimes it’s better to give up than keep going (persistence doesn’t always pay) - why a step-by-step approach isn’t always the right choice (and what to do instead) - the myth of getting rich slowly - why there’s no single recipe for success and why you shouldn’t look for one - the halo effect and its effect on our judgment of successful people - what the Japanese streets can teach you about doing the opposite thing and still being right - two types of perfectionism and why one of them can change your life - why you don’t need more discipline (and what you need instead of discipline) - how long it really takes to develop a habit Would You Like to Achieve Success by Following the Unconventional Path? By following the unconventional advice from the book you can achieve much better results than by following the traditional way of doing things. Some of the most common self-help tips can actually harm you instead of helping you. Debunking the Top 9 Self-Help Myths will help you avoid doing things that have been proven by the scientists to harm you instead of helping you. You too can benefit from the self-help literature – but first you have to learn how to read them critically, and this book will help you achieve this goal. PS. All readers will get access to a bonus chapter of the book that explains why productivity systems are useless.

South of Broad,['Pat Conroy'],Atlantic Books Ltd,2010-07-01,"The number one New York Times bestseller Leopold Bloom King is the son of an amiable, loving father who teaches science at the local high school. His mother, a former nun, is the high school principal and a respected Joyce scholar. He has had an unremarkable, happy family life. But after Leo's ten-year-old brother commits suicide, the family struggles with the shattering effects of his death, and Leo, lonely and isolated, searches for something to sustain him. Eventually, he finds his answer when he becomes part of a tight knit group of older high school students that includes Sheba and Trevor Poe - glamorous twins with an alcoholic mother and a prison-escapee father - hard-scrabble mountain runaways Niles and Starla Whitehead; socialite Molly Huger and her boyfriend, Chadworth Rutledge X. It's an ever-widening circle whose liaisons will ripple across two decades, from 1960s counterculture through to the dawn of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. The ties among them endure for years, surviving marriages happy and troubled, unrequited loves and unspoken longings, hard-won successes and devastating breakdowns, as well as the American South's dark legacy of racism and class divisions. But the final test of friendship that brings them to San Francisco is something no one is prepared for.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781848879980'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1848879989'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",413.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.10.10.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QFwcb7vx-IgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QFwcb7vx-IgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QFwcb7vx-IgC&pg=PT50&dq=intitle:SOUTH+OF+BROAD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QFwcb7vx-IgC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QFwcb7vx-IgC,,,,,

Dreamfever,['Karen Marie Moning'],Delacorte Press,2009-08-18,"In New York Times bestselling author Karen Marie Moning’s stunning novel, the walls between human and Fae worlds have come crashing down. And as Mac fights for survival on Dublin’s battle-scarred streets, she will embark on the darkest adventure of her life. MacKayla Lane lies naked on the cold stone floor of a church, at the mercy of the Fae master she once swore to kill. Far from home, unable to control her sexual hungers, MacKayla is now fully under the Lord Master’s spell. He has stolen her past, but MacKayla will never allow her sister’s murderer to take her future. Yet even the uniquely gifted sidhe-seer is no match for the Lord Master, who has unleashed an insatiable sexual craving that consumes Mac’s every thought—and thrusts her into the seductive realm of two very dangerous men, both of whom she desires but dares not trust. As the enigmatic Jericho Barrons and the sensual Fae prince V’lane vie for her body and soul, as cryptic entries from her sister’s diary mysteriously appear and the power of the Dark Book weaves its annihilating path through the city, Mac’s greatest enemy delivers a final challenge. It’s an invitation Mac cannot refuse, one that sends her racing home to Georgia, where an even darker threat awaits. With her parents missing and the lives of her loved ones under siege, Mac is about to come face-to-face with a soul-shattering truth—about herself and her sister, about Jericho Barrons . . . and about the world she thought she knew.

Rough Country,['Robert Wuthnow'],Princeton University Press,2016-04-05,"How the history of Texas illuminates America's post–Civil War past Tracing the intersection of religion, race, and power in Texas from Reconstruction through the rise of the Religious Right and the failed presidential bid of Governor Rick Perry, Rough Country illuminates American history since the Civil War in new ways, demonstrating that Texas's story is also America’s. In particular, Robert Wuthnow shows how distinctions between ""us"" and “them” are perpetuated and why they are so often shaped by religion and politics. Early settlers called Texas a rough country. Surviving there necessitated defining evil, fighting it, and building institutions in the hope of advancing civilization. Religion played a decisive role. Today, more evangelical Protestants live in Texas than in any other state. They have influenced every presidential election for fifty years, mobilized powerful efforts against abortion and same-sex marriage, and been a driving force in the Tea Party movement. And religion has always been complicated by race and ethnicity. Drawing from memoirs, newspapers, oral history, voting records, and surveys, Rough Country tells the stories of ordinary men and women who struggled with the conditions they faced, conformed to the customs they knew, and on occasion emerged as powerful national leaders. We see the lasting imprint of slavery, public executions, Jim Crow segregation, and resentment against the federal government. We also observe courageous efforts to care for the sick, combat lynching, provide for the poor, welcome new immigrants, and uphold liberty of conscience. A monumental and magisterial history, Rough Country is as much about the rest of America as it is about Texas.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780691169309'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0691169306'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",662.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F26YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=F26YDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=F26YDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=intitle:ROUGH+COUNTRY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=F26YDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:ROUGH+COUNTRY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Rough_Country.html?hl=&id=F26YDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Nine Dragons,['George Herman'],Tuttle Publishing,2011-10-21,"With unique illustrations based on classical Chinese painting, this multicultural children's story tells a classic folktale that children will love. Long ago, in a far-off land, two tribes shared a common legend — they believed the mountains between them were the home of nine terrible and terrifying dragons. For generations, fear of the dragons kept the two tribes apart, until a catastrophic drought forced them into the mountains in search of food. Nine Dragons tells the story of how the two tribes prepared to go to war over their dwindling resources, and how the oldest and wisest of the nine dragons convinced the others that they had to stop the battle before it started. Based on themes from Asian folklore, and taking place in a mythical Asian setting, Nine Dragons is an inspirational tale about overcoming mistrust and misunderstanding to achieve peace. The vibrant full-color illustrations, along with the timeless story, will appeal to children and their parents.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781462901258'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1462901255'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",48.0,BOOK,['Juvenile Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.10.14.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GybRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GybRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=GybRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NINE+DRAGONS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GybRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GybRAgAAQBAJ,,,A Contemporary Fable,,
The Scarpetta Factor,['Patricia Cornwell'],Penguin,2009-10-20,"In this provocative thriller, forensic expert Kay Scarpetta is surrounded by familiar faces, yet traveling down the unfamiliar road of fame.... It is the week before Christmas. A tanking economy has prompted Dr. Kay Scarpetta—despite her busy schedule and her continuing work as the senior forensic analyst for CNN—to offer her services pro bono to New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In no time at all, her increased visibility seems to precipitate a string of unexpected and unsettling events, culminating in an ominous package—possibly a bomb—showing up at the front desk of the apartment building where she and her husband, Benton, live. Soon the apparent threat on Scarpetta’s life finds her embroiled in a surreal plot that includes a famous actor accused of an unthinkable sex crime and the disappearance of a beautiful millionaire with whom her niece, Lucy, seems to have shared a secret past. Scarpetta’s CNN producer wants her to launch a TV show called The Scarpetta Factor. Given the bizarre events already in play, she fears that her growing fame will generate the illusion that she has a “special factor,” a mythical ability to solve all her cases. She wonders if she will end up like other TV personalities: her own stereotype.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101148907'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '110114890X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",592.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.13.11.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-4JaSBhEmmgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-4JaSBhEmmgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-4JaSBhEmmgC&pg=PT311&dq=intitle:THE+SCARPETTA+FACTOR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-4JaSBhEmmgC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-4JaSBhEmmgC,4.0,5.0,Scarpetta (Book 17),,

Under the Dome,['Stephen King'],Simon and Schuster,2013-06-11,"On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester's Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener's hand is severed as ""the dome"" comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when -- or if -- it will go away. Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens -- town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician's assistant at the hospital, a select-woman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing -- even murder -- to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn't just short.

The last of her line, she faces a momentous choice: expose a long-held family secret, or take it with her to her grave. Olivia has in her possession letters from her deceased cousin Catherine, a nun, now being considered for beatification by the Catholic Church. These letters reveal that, at the age of seventeen, Catherine gave birth to a son and gave him up for adoption and they identify the father as Alex Gannon, a world-famous doctor, scientist and inventor of medical patents. Now, two generations later, thirty-one year old paediatrician, Dr. Monica Farrell, Catherine's granddaughter, stands as the rightful heir to what remains of the Gannon family fortune. But in telling Monica who she really is and getting what is lawfully hers, Olivia would have to betray Catherine's wishes and reveal the story behind Monica's ancestry. But as the pressure of Olivia's impending choice weighs down on her, little does she realize that Alex Gannon's grand-nephews - who are currently exploiting the Gannon inheritance to fund their profligate lifestyles - will stop at nothing to silence Olivia and prevent Monica from learning the secret, even murder.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781847377883'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1847377882'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",336.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.4.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B4n8em0jmNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B4n8em0jmNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=B4n8em0jmNUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+SHADOW+OF+YOUR+SMILE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=B4n8em0jmNUC&dq=intitle:THE+SHADOW+OF+YOUR+SMILE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Shadow_of_Your_Smile.html?hl=&id=B4n8em0jmNUC,,,,,
Deliver Us from Evil: A New York City Cop Investigates the Supernatural,"['Ralph Sarchie', 'Lisa Collier Cool']",St. Martin's Paperbacks,2014-06-03,"Demonic possession. Exorcism. Haunted Houses. Satanic Rituals. For most people this is the stuff of nightmares, horror movies, folklore, and superstition. For New York City police Sergeant Ralph Sarchie, it's as real—and dangerous—as midnight patrol . . . A sixteen-year NYPD veteran, Ralph Sarchie works out of the 46th Precinct in New York's South Bronx. But it is his other job that he calls ""the Work"": investigating cases of demonic possession and assisting in the exorcisms of humanity's most ancient—and most dangerous—foes. Now he discloses for the first time his investigations into incredible true crimes and inhuman evil that were never explained, solved, or understood except by Sarchie and his partner. Schooled in the rituals of exorcism, and an eyewitness to the reality of demonic possession, Ralph Sarchie has documented a riveting chronicle of the inexplicable that gives a new shape to the shadows in the dark. In Deliver Us from Evil, he takes readers into the very hierarchy of a hell on earth to expose the grisly rituals of a Palo Mayombe priest; a young girl whose innocence is violated by an incubus; a home invaded by the malevolent spirit of a supposedly murdered nineteenth-century bride; the dark side of a couple who were literally, the neighbors from hell; and more. Ralph Sarchie's revelations are a powerful and disturbing documented link between the true-crime realities of life and the blood-chilling ice-grip of a supernatural terror.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466866942'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466866942'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['True Crime'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zh3SAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zh3SAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zh3SAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DELIVER+US+FROM+EVIL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zh3SAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zh3SAgAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,,,

The Heart of the Matter,['Graham Greene'],Open Road Media,2018-04-10,"“From first page to last . . . an engrossing novel” of betrayal and espionage on a colonial outpost during World War II (The New York Times). In a British colony in West Africa, Henry Scobie is a pious and righteous man of modest means enlisted with securing borders. But when he’s passed over for a promotion as commissioner of police, the humiliation hits hardest for his wife, Louise. Already oppressed by the appalling climate, frustrated in a loveless marriage, and belittled by the wives of more privileged officers, Louise wants out. Feeling responsible for her unhappiness, Henry decides against his better judgment to accept a loan from a black marketeer to secure Louise’s passage. It’s just a single indiscretion, yet for Henry it precipitates a rapid fall from grace as one moral compromise after another leads him into a web of blackmail, adultery, and murder.

The Spy Story,"['John G. Cawelti', 'Bruce A. Rosenberg']",University of Chicago Press,1987-05,"Why has the spy story become such a popular form of entertainment in our time? In this fascinating account of the genre's evolution, John G. Cawelti and Bruce A. Rosenberg explore the social, political, and artistic sources of the spy story's wide appeal. They show how, in a time of bewildering political and corporate organization, the spy story has become increasingly relevant, the secret agent hero expressing the feelings of divided and ambiguous loyalties with which many individuals face the modern world. In addition to a general history of the genre, Cawelti and Rosenberg present in-depth analyses of the work of certain writers who have given the spy story its shape, among them John Buchan, Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, Ian Fleming, and John le Carré. The Spy Story also includes an extensive appendix, featuring a literary and historical bibliography of espionage and clandestinity, a list of the best spy novels and films, a catalog of major spy writers and their heroes, and a selection of novels on espionage themes written by major twentieth-century authors and public figures. Written in a lively style that reflects the authors' enthusiasm for this intriguing form, The Spy Story will be read with pleasure by devotees of the genre as well as students of popular culture.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0226098680'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780226098685'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",284.0,BOOK,['Literary Criticism'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.8.6.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vNm0_p7IHRMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vNm0_p7IHRMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vNm0_p7IHRMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+SPY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=vNm0_p7IHRMC&dq=intitle:THE+SPY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Spy_Story.html?hl=&id=vNm0_p7IHRMC,,,,,

The Last Passage,['Donald Heinz'],Oxford University Press,1998-12-17,"Is death merely the cessation of life? Are our final years simply a wearing out of the body? Are hospitals and funeral homes--the bureaucratic machinery of death--capable of handling the profound spiritual dimension of dying? In The Last Passage, Donald Heinz offers wise answers to these questions in a book that urges us to ""recover a death of our own"" and to view our final years as a fulfillment, a ""last career."" Despite the recent spate of books on death and dying, death remains a fact our culture tries desperately to ignore. In other times and in other cultures, preparing for death was seen as an important spiritual task--perhaps the most important task of our lives. Heinz argues that we can reconceive of death, reinvest it with meaning, and save it from becoming a meaningless biological event. Seeking appropriate models for such a reconstruction, Heinz offers a fascinating overview of the many ways death has been envisioned and ritualized throughout human history, from the Tibetan Book of the Dead to 15th century Christian ars moriendi--manuals on the art of dying--and from Jean Paul Sartre to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross. He also surveys the more recent contributions of psychologists, anthropologists, cultural critics, and death awareness advocates, whose efforts have largely failed to integrate death into a larger human story and the larger human community. Finally, Heinz shows us how we might create rituals through the use of music, visual arts, dance, drama, and language that would enable us to approach death with reverence, as the spiritual consummation of our lives.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780198027607'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0198027605'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",319.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eaUzpu3UnfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eaUzpu3UnfwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eaUzpu3UnfwC&pg=PR10&dq=intitle:THE+PASSAGE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eaUzpu3UnfwC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eaUzpu3UnfwC,,,Recovering a Death of Our Own,,
The Overton Window,['Glenn Beck'],Simon and Schuster,2010-06-15,"A plan to destroy America, a hundred years in the making, is about to be unleashed . . . can it be stopped? There is a powerful technique called the Overton Window that can shape our lives, our laws, and our future. It works by manipulating public perception so that ideas previously thought of as radical begin to seem acceptable over time. Move the Window and you change the debate. Change the debate and you change the country. For Noah Gardner, a twentysomething public relations executive, it’s safe to say that political theory is the furthest thing from his mind. Smart, single, handsome, and insulated from the world’s problems by the wealth and power of his father, Noah is far more concerned about the future of his social life than the future of his country. But all of that changes when Noah meets Molly Ross, a woman who is consumed by the knowledge that the America we know is about to be lost forever. She and her group of patriots have vowed to remember the past and fight for the future—but Noah, convinced they’re just misguided conspiracy-theorists, isn’t interested in lending his considerable skills to their cause. And then the world changes. An unprecedented attack on U.S. soil shakes the country to the core and puts into motion a frightening plan, decades in the making, to transform America and demonize all those who stand in the way. Amidst the chaos, many don’t know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact—or, more important, which side to fight for. But for Noah, the choice is clear: Exposing the plan, and revealing the conspirators behind it, is the only way to save both the woman he loves and the individual freedoms he once took for granted. After five back-to-back #1 New York Times bestsellers, national radio and Fox News television host Glenn Beck has delivered a ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that seamlessly weaves together American history, frightening facts about our present condition, and a heart-stopping plot. The Overton Window will educate, enlighten, and, most important, entertain—with twists and revelations no one will see coming.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781439190111'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1439190119'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",338.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.14.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DaDP_S-bMlgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DaDP_S-bMlgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DaDP_S-bMlgC&pg=PA51&dq=intitle:THE+OVERTON+WINDOW&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DaDP_S-bMlgC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DaDP_S-bMlgC,4.5,11.0,,,
Sizzling Sixteen,['Janet Evanovich'],St. Martin's Press,2010-06-22,"Trenton, New Jersey, bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has inherited a ""lucky"" bottle from her Uncle Pip. Problem is, Uncle Pip didn't specify if the bottle brought good luck or bad luck. . . . BAD LUCK: Vinnie, of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds, has run up a gambling debt of $786,000 with mobster Bobby Sunflower and is being held until the cash can be produced. Nobody else will pay to get Vinnie back, leaving it up to Stephanie, office manager Connie, and file clerk Lula to raise the money if they want to save their jobs. GOOD LUCK: Being in the business of tracking down people, Stephanie, Lula, and Connie have an advantage in finding Vinnie. If they can rescue him, it will buy them some time to raise the cash. BAD LUCK: Finding a safe place to hide Vinnie turns out to be harder than raising $786,000. Vinnie's messing up Mooner's vibe, running up pay-per-view porn charges in Ranger's apartment, and making Stephanie question genetics. GOOD LUCK: Between a bonds office yard sale that has the entire Burg turning out, Mooner's Hobbit-Con charity event, and Uncle Pip's lucky bottle, they just might raise enough money to save the business, and Vinnie, from ruin. BAD LUCK: Saving Vincent Plum Bail Bonds means Stephanie can keep being a bounty hunter. In Trenton, this involves hunting down a man wanted for polygamy, a turnpike toilet paper bandit, and a drug dealer with a pet alligator named Mr. Jingles. GOOD LUCK: The job of bounty hunter comes with perks in the guise of Trenton's hottest cop, Joe Morelli, and the dark and dangerous security expert, Ranger.

The Oxford Handbook of Job Loss and Job Search,"['Ute-Christine Klehe PhD', 'Edwin van Hooft PhD']",Oxford University Press,2018-05-08,"Job search is and always has been an integral part of people's working lives. Whether one is brand new to the labor market or considered a mature, experienced worker, job seekers are regularly met with new challenges in a variety of organizational settings. Edited by Ute-Christine Klehe and Edwin A.J. van Hooft, The Oxford Handbook of Job Loss and Job Search provides readers with one of the first comprehensive overviews of the latest research and empirical knowledge in the areas of job loss and job search. Multidisciplinary in nature, Klehe, van Hooft, and their contributing authors offer fascinating insight into the diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives from which job loss and job search have been studied, such as psychology, sociology, labor studies, and economics. Discussing the antecedents and consequences of job loss, as well as outside circumstances that may necessitate a more rigorous job hunt, this Handbook presents in-depth and up-to-date knowledge on the methods and processes of this important time in one's life. Further, it examines the unique circumstances faced by different populations during their job search, such as those working job-to-job, the unemployed, mature job seekers, international job seekers, and temporary employed workers. Job loss and unemployment are among the worst stressors individuals can encounter during their lifetimes. As a result, this Handbook concludes with a discussion of the various types of interventions developed to aid the unemployed. Further, it offers readers important insights and identifies best practices for both scholars and practitioners working in the areas of job loss, unemployment, career transitions, outplacement, and job search.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780190903503'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0190903503'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",608.0,BOOK,['Psychology'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-4BZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-4BZDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-4BZDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA401&dq=intitle:THE+SEARCH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-4BZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-4BZDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Spider Bones,['Kathy Reichs'],Simon and Schuster,2014-10-14,"A complex and riveting tale of deceit and murder unfolds in this repackage of the thirteenth thrilling novel in Reichs’s ""cleverly plotted and expertly maintained series"" (The New York Times Book Review). John Lowery was declared dead in 1968—the victim of a Huey crash in Vietnam, his body buried long ago in North Carolina. Four decades later, Temperance Brennan is called to the scene of a drowning in Hemmingford, Quebec. The victim appears to have died while in the midst of a bizarre sexual practice. The corpse is later identified as John Lowery. But how could Lowery have died twice, and how did an American soldier end up in Canada? Tempe sets off for the answer, exhuming Lowery’s grave in North Carolina and taking the remains to Hawaii for reanalysis—to the headquarters of JPAC, the U.S. military’s Joint POW/ MIA Accounting Command, which strives to recover Americans who have died in past conflicts. In Hawaii, Tempe is joined by her colleague and ex-lover Detective Andrew Ryan (how ""ex"" is he?) and by her daughter, who is recovering from her own tragic loss. Soon another set of remains is located, with Lowery’s dog tags tangled among them. Three bodies—all identified as Lowery. And then Tempe is contacted by Hadley Perry, Honolulu’s flamboyant medical examiner, who needs help identifying the remains of an adolescent boy found offshore. Was he the victim of a shark attack? Or something much more sinister?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501102769'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501102761'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dte5BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dte5BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dte5BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SPIDER+BONES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dte5BAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:SPIDER+BONES&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Spider_Bones.html?hl=&id=Dte5BAAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,
Development as Freedom,['Amartya Sen'],Anchor,2011-05-25,"By the winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Economics, an essential and paradigm-altering framework for understanding economic development--for both rich and poor--in the twenty-first century. Freedom, Sen argues, is both the end and most efficient means of sustaining economic life and the key to securing the general welfare of the world's entire population. Releasing the idea of individual freedom from association with any particular historical, intellectual, political, or religious tradition, Sen clearly demonstrates its current applicability and possibilities. In the new global economy, where, despite unprecedented increases in overall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary freedoms to vast numbers--perhaps even the majority of people--he concludes, it is still possible to practically and optimistically restain a sense of social accountability. Development as Freedom is essential reading.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307874290'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '030787429X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",384.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.7.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XmfIeDy_taYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XmfIeDy_taYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XmfIeDy_taYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FREEDOM&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XmfIeDy_taYC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XmfIeDy_taYC,5.0,1.0,,,

Safe Haven,['Rae Bridgman'],University of Toronto Press,2002-01-01,"In this groundbreaking work, urban anthropologist Rae Bridgman, in careful and intimate detail, explores the perspectives of the women who work and live at Savard's, a unique shelter for homeless women. Bridgman uses the design and development of Savard's - a housing model developed by women for women - as an opportunity to document the project's original vision and what happened once it opened. There are few rules at Savard's. Women may come and go as they wish, and referrals to other services are made only when a woman has indicated interest in taking action on her own behalf. It is a model that aims to provide a safe haven for the chronically homeless. The study traces the evolution of this type of shelter, providing qualitative research and useful analysis for academics, policy-makers, service providers, and activists. Based on many hours of participant observation as well as interviews and staff records, Safe Haven presents a distinct picture of the chronically homeless and those on the frontlines of this lifesaving service.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0802080847'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780802080844'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",180.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.4.4.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VHR3uBy9sBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VHR3uBy9sBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VHR3uBy9sBoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SAFE+HAVEN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VHR3uBy9sBoC&dq=intitle:SAFE+HAVEN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Safe_Haven.html?hl=&id=VHR3uBy9sBoC,,,The Story of a Shelter for Homeless Women,,

'Flynn is een meester - misschien wel dé meester - van thrillers waarbij de pagina's zichzelf om lijken te slaan.'- Book Reporter Mitch Rapp was een veelbelovende atleet in zijn studententijd... En toen sloeg het noodlot toe: terroristen doodden tijdens een wrede aanslag meer dan tweehonderd onschuldige burgers, onder wie zijn vriendin. Familie en vrienden die achterbleven waren in diepe rouw en probeerden troost te vinden. Maar Rapp wilde slechts één ding: vergelding. Na twee decennia van politiek falen staan de Verenigde Staten en de CIA er slecht voor. De Operations Director van de CIA, Koude Oorlog-veteraan Thomas Stansfield, weet dat hij zich moet voorbereiden op de volgende oorlog: de strijd tussen de VS en islamitische jihadisten. Hij geeft zijn opvolger Irene Kennedy en zijn beste vriend Stan Hurley de opdracht om een groep clandestiene operatives op te richten. Agenten die in het diepste geheim opereren. Zes maanden wordt het uiterste van Rapp gevergd tijdens een training die zo intens is dat hij er bijna aan ten onder gaat. Gehard door deze elite-opleiding is hij er klaar voor om zijn vijanden uit te schakelen. Hij begint in Istanboel, waar de wapenhandelaar die de explosieven voor de aanslag verkocht zijn eerste doelwit is. Daarna trekken hij en zijn team door Europa, waar ze de ene na de andere terrorist zonder genade uitschakelen. In de stoffige straten van Beiroet bereikt het verhaal zijn hoogte punt als Rapp plotseling zelf doelwit is. Hij zal zijn training en vaardigheden tot het uiterste moeten inzetten als hij wil overleven in deze door oorlog geteisterde stad.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789045212951'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9045212951'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.2.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RpJNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RpJNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=RpJNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:AMERICAN+ASSASSIN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RpJNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RpJNDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Confession,['Robert Whitlow'],Thomas Nelson,2014-08-12,"""Fans of John Grisham will find much to like here."" —Library Journal Confession is good for the soul, but it could mean death to an ambitious young lawyer. Assistant DA Holt Douglas has made a career of getting confessions from criminals. With a confession in hand, he knows a guilty plea is soon to follow. In the midst of professional success, Holt is haunted by a secret—a lie he buried in the grave of his best friend. Holt’s crime is hidden from all eyes—family, friends, police, and his soon-to-be fiancé. But the truth has a way of coming back to life. With obsessive prosecutorial zeal, Holt reopens a cold case involving the death of the town’s wealthiest citizen. The man’s death was ruled a suicide, but Holt suspects murder. Facing fierce opposition, he is determined to expose the killer. Holt slowly begins to unravel the facts. And comes face-to-face with his own guilty conscience. With his job, his relationship with the woman he loves, and his future at risk, Holt skirts the boundary between truth and lies, confession and hypocrisy, redemption and ruin. Can he survive long enough to finally make the right choice? “Readers will find plenty to love about this suspenseful novel as they watch its appealing main character juggle personal, professional, and spiritual crisis with a combination of vulnerability and strength.” —CBA Retailers and Resources, regarding The Living Room","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781401688875'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '140168887X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",417.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sxzFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sxzFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=sxzFAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+CONFESSION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sxzFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sxzFAgAAQBAJ,,,,,
Towers of Midnight,"['Robert Jordan', 'Brandon Sanderson']",Tor Books,2011-01-31,"The Wheel of Time is now an original series on Prime Video, starring Rosamund Pike as Moiraine! With Robert Jordan’s untimely passing in 2007, Brandon Sanderson, the New York Times bestselling author of the Mistborn novels and the Stormlight Archive, was chosen by Jordan’s editor—his wife, Harriet McDougal—to complete the final volume in The Wheel of Time®, later expanded to three books. In Towers of Midnight, the thirteenth novel in Jordan’s #1 New York Times bestselling epic fantasy series, the Last Battle has truly begun. The seals on the Dark One’s prison are crumbling. The Pattern itself is unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight. The sun has begun to set upon the Third Age. And trials by fire await those fighting against the darkness that encroaches from their enemies—and within themselves... Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves, and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in Tel'aran'rhiod and find a way—at long last—to master the wolf within him or lose himself to it forever. Mat Cauthon must once again face the creatures beyond the stone gateways, the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The Tower of Ghenjei awaits, and its secrets will reveal the fate of a friend long lost. Rand al’Thor, the Dragon Reborn, arrives at the White Tower with a startling revelation for Egwene al’Vere. Fearful for his sanity, Egwene summons the rulers of the Borderlands to stand against him—knowing the fate of the world rests in their hands. Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.

Evil is bad that believes it’s good.” MacKayla Lane was just a child when she and her sister, Alina, were given up for adoption and banished from Ireland forever. Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister’s murderer. But after discovering that she descends from a bloodline both gifted and cursed, Mac is plunged into a secret history: an ancient conflict between humans and immortals who have lived concealed among us for thousands of years. What follows is a shocking chain of events with devastating consequences, and now Mac struggles to cope with grief while continuing her mission to acquire and control the Sinsar Dubh—a book of dark, forbidden magic scribed by the mythical Unseelie King, containing the power to create and destroy worlds. In an epic battle between humans and Fae, the hunter becomes the hunted when the Sinsar Dubh turns on Mac and begins mowing a deadly path through those she loves. Who can she turn to? Who can she trust? Who is the woman haunting her dreams? More important, who is Mac herself and what is the destiny she glimpses in the black and crimson designs of an ancient tarot card? From the luxury of the Lord Master’s penthouse to the sordid depths of an Unseelie nightclub, from the erotic bed of her lover to the terrifying bed of the Unseelie King, Mac’s journey will force her to face the truth of her exile, and to make a choice that will either save the world . . . or destroy it.

Chasing Fire,['Nora Roberts'],Penguin,2011-04-12,"In this #1 New York Times bestseller, Nora Roberts delves into the world of elite firefighters who thrive on danger and adrenaline—men and women who wouldn’t know how to live life if it wasn’t on the edge. Little else in life is as dangerous as fire jumping. But there’s also little else as thrilling—at least to Rowan Tripp. Being a Missoula smoke jumper is in Rowan’s blood: her father is a legend in the field. At this point, returning to the wilds of Montana for the season feels like coming home—even with reminders of the partner she lost last season still lingering in the air. One of the best of this year’s rookie crop, Gulliver Curry is a walking contradiction, a hotshot firefighter with a big vocabulary and a winter job at a kids’ arcade. And though Rowan, as a rule, doesn’t hook up with other smoke jumpers, Gull is convinced he can change her mind...

The Sixth Man,"['Andre Iguodala', 'Carvell Wallace']",Penguin,2019-06-25,"**The Instant National Bestseller** The standout memoir from NBA powerhouse Andre Iguodala, the indomitable sixth man of the Golden State Warriors. Andre Iguodala is one of the most admired players in the NBA. And fresh off the Warriors’ fifth Finals appearance in five years, his game has never been stronger. Off the court, Iguodala has earned respect, too—for his successful tech investments, his philanthropy, and increasingly for his contributions to the conversation about race in America. It is no surprise, then, that in his first book, Andre, with his cowriter Carvell Wallace, has pushed himself to go further than he ever has before about his life, not only as an athlete but about what makes him who he is at his core. The Sixth Man traces Andre’s journey from childhood in his Illinois hometown to his Bay Area home court today. Basketball has always been there. But this is the story, too, of his experience of the conflict and racial tension always at hand in a professional league made up largely of African American men; of whether and why the athlete owes the total sacrifice of his body; of the relationship between competition and brotherhood among the players of one of history’s most glorious championship teams. And of what motivates an athlete to keep striving for more once they’ve already achieved the highest level of play they could have dreamed. On drive, on leadership, on pain, on accomplishment, on the shame of being given a role, and the glory of taking a role on: This is a powerful memoir of life and basketball that reveals new depths to the superstar athlete, and offers tremendous insight into most urgent stories being told in American society today.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525534006'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525534008'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",256.0,BOOK,['Biography & Autobiography'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BoBxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BoBxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BoBxDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+SIXTH+MAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoBxDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BoBxDwAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,A Memoir,,
Death in American Texts and Performances,['Mark Pizzato'],Routledge,2016-05-13,"How do twentieth and twenty-first century artists bring forth the powerful reality of death when it exists in memory and lived experience as something that happens only to others? Death in American Texts and Performances takes up this question to explore the modern and postmodern aesthetics of death. Working between and across genres, the contributors examine literary texts and performance media, including Robert Lowell's For the Union Dead, Luis Valdez' Dark Root of a Scream, Amiri Baraka's Dutchman, Thornton Wilder's Our Town, John Edgar Wideman's The Cattle Killing, Toni Morrison's Sula and Song of Solomon, Don DeLillo's White Noise and Falling Man, and HBO's Six Feet Under. As the contributors struggle to convey the artist's crisis of representation, they often locate the dilemma in the gap between artifice and nature, where loss is performed and where re-membering is sometimes literally reenacted through the bodily gesture. While artists confront the impossibility of total recovery or transformation, so must the contributors explore the gulf between real corpses and their literary or performative reconstructions. Ultimately, the volume shows both artist and critic grappling with the dilemma of showing how the aesthetics of death as absence is made meaningful in and by language.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781317154440'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1317154444'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",254.0,BOOK,['Literary Criticism'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.6.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jw0pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jw0pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jw0pDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BEL-AIR+DEAD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jw0pDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jw0pDAAAQBAJ,,,"Corpses, Ghosts, and the Reanimated Dead",,

Hit List,['Brian G. Hedges'],Cruciform Press,2014-11-01,"The Christian life is a war and one of your most lethal enemies hangs its helmet inside your heart. This infernal, internal enemy is sin, which even after new birth continues to reside in every believer. As followers of Jesus, we’ve been given a simple mission regarding sin: search and destroy. Put it to death. But in the words of Cornelius Plantinga Jr., “sin has a thousand faces.” It is one thing to oppose sin in principle, quite another to actually do the bloody work of crucifying specific sin patterns in our lives. Sometimes these patterns are difficult to detect. Always they fight back, tooth and nail, mounting vehement resistance in counter-maneuvers of a variety and complexity that would send General Schwarzkopf’s mind spinning like a tilt-a-whirl. The most famous faces of sin are the Seven Deadly Sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. Not merely corrupting vices in themselves, these seven are gateway sins leading to countless others. They are the leading undercover operatives for the world, the flesh, and the devil—that evil complex of powers arrayed against our souls. And while we may recognize these sins by their names, we are often misled by the subtlety of their methods and ways. These sins are masters of disguise, adept at masking their true nature in charades of harmlessness, acceptability, and fun. In Hit List, Brian Hedges helps us take aim at the seven deadly sins by providing detailed dossiers for each one and equipping us with rich gospel resources for replacing vice with the virtue of Christ.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781936760664'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1936760665'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",111.0,BOOK,['Religion'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1UslBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1UslBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1UslBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&dq=intitle:HIT+LIST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1UslBQAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:HIT+LIST&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Hit_List.html?hl=&id=1UslBQAAQBAJ,,,Taking Aim at the Seven Deadly Sins,,

It Happened One Summer,['Tessa Bailey'],HarperCollins,2021-07-13,"The first in a spicy and unforgettable rom-com duology from #1 New York Times bestseller and tik tok favorite Tessa Bailey, in which a Hollywood “It Girl” is cut off from her wealthy family and exiled to a small Pacific Northwest beach town... where she butts heads with a surly, sexy local who thinks she doesn’t belong. Piper Bellinger is fashionable, influential, and her reputation as a wild child means the paparazzi are constantly on her heels. When too much champagne and an out-of-control rooftop party lands Piper in the slammer, her stepfather decides enough is enough. So he cuts her off, and sends Piper and her sister to learn some responsibility running their late father’s dive bar... in Washington. Piper hasn’t even been in Westport for five minutes when she meets big, bearded sea captain Brendan, who thinks she won’t last a week outside of Beverly Hills. So what if Piper can’t do math, and the idea of sleeping in a shabby apartment with bunk beds gives her hives. How bad could it really be? She’s determined to show her stepfather—and the hot, grumpy local—that she’s more than a pretty face. Except it’s a small town and everywhere she turns, she bumps into Brendan. The fun-loving socialite and the gruff fisherman are polar opposites, but there’s an undeniable attraction simmering between them. Piper doesn’t want any distractions, especially feelings for a man who sails off into the sunset for weeks at a time. Yet as she reconnects with her past and begins to feel at home in Westport, Piper starts to wonder if the cold, glamorous life she knew is what she truly wants. LA is calling her name, but Brendan—and this town full of memories—may have already caught her heart.

A Dance with Dragons,['George R. R. Martin'],Bantam,2011-07-12,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • THE BOOK BEHIND THE FIFTH SEASON OF THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES Don’t miss the thrilling sneak peek of George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Six, The Winds of Winter Dubbed “the American Tolkien” by Time magazine, George R. R. Martin has earned international acclaim for his monumental cycle of epic fantasy. Now the #1 New York Times bestselling author delivers the fifth book in his landmark series—as both familiar faces and surprising new forces vie for a foothold in a fragmented empire. A DANCE WITH DRAGONS A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE: BOOK FIVE In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance—beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind. Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever. Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice. From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.

The next day, a NASCAR crew member comes to Temperance Brennan’s office at the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner to share a devastating story. Twelve years earlier, Wayne Gamble’s sister, Cindi, then a high school senior and aspiring racer, disappeared along with her boyfriend, Cale Lovette.

During the first eight decades of the twentieth century, the increase of educated workers was higher than the demand for them. This boosted income for most people and lowered inequality. However, the reverse has been true since about 1980.

In the cafés on College Hill, the wised-up kids are inhaling Derrida and listening to Talking Heads. But Madeleine Hanna, dutiful English major, is writing her senior thesis on Jane Austen and George Eliot, purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. As Madeleine tries to understand why ""it became laughable to read writers like Cheever and Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France,"" real life, in the form of two very different guys, intervenes. Leonard Bankhead—charismatic loner, college Darwinist, and lost Portland boy—suddenly turns up in a semiotics seminar, and soon Madeleine finds herself in a highly charged erotic and intellectual relationship with him. At the same time, her old ""friend"" Mitchell Grammaticus—who's been reading Christian mysticism and generally acting strange—resurfaces, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate. Over the next year, as the members of the triangle in this amazing, spellbinding novel graduate from college and enter the real world, events force them to reevaluate everything they learned in school. Leonard and Madeleine move to a biology Laboratory on Cape Cod, but can't escape the secret responsible for Leonard's seemingly inexhaustible energy and plunging moods. And Mitchell, traveling around the world to get Madeleine out of his mind, finds himself face-to-face with ultimate questions about the meaning of life, the existence of God, and the true nature of love. Are the great love stories of the nineteenth century dead? Or can there be a new story, written for today and alive to the realities of feminism, sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce? With devastating wit and an abiding understanding of and affection for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides revives the motivating energies of the Novel, while creating a story so contemporary and fresh that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781429969185'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1429969180'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",418.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.12.10.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YPOixQM7VN0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YPOixQM7VN0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=YPOixQM7VN0C&pg=PA22&dq=intitle:THE+MARRIAGE+PLOT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YPOixQM7VN0C&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YPOixQM7VN0C,3.0,45.0,A Novel,,

Kwam een vrouw bij de slijterij,['Bonnie Jongebloed-Swart'],Vior Webmedia,2021-07-14,"In mijn autobiografie neem ik jullie graag mee in mijn veelbewogen leven. Ik zit inmiddels méér dan 50 jaar in 'het vak', waar ik natuurlijk enorm trots op ben. Ik kan terugkijken op een heel succesvolle carriére waarin ik mooie hoogtepunten mocht beleven. En hoewel de meeste mensen mij voornamelijk kennen van Nederlandstalige hits als ""Bonnie Kom Je Buiten Spelen' en 'Dr. Bernard', zul je lezen dat ik ook veel ander (Engelstalig) repertoire heb opgenomen, en ooit ben begonnen als een echte rock zangeres! Mijn carriére kende ook veel dieptepunten natuurlijk. Zo ben ik veelvuldig neergesabeld door de pers. Er zijn vaak verhalen verschenen, waarin ik mezelf geheel niet in kon vinden. Mede daarom vond ik het ook tijd om mijn eigen verhaal te delen. En het heeft heel bevrijdend gewerkt om in mijn eigen woorden te vertellen hoe ik mijn leven heb geleefd, zonder dingen uit zijn verband te rukken Jarenlang ben ik het een beetje uit de weg gegaan. Misschien was ik er onbewust zelf nog niet aan toe, had het daarom steeds op de lange baan geschoven. Ik realiseerde me terdege dat er heel confronterende gebeurtenissen aan de orde zouden komen. En vooral confronterend voor mezelf. Sinds 1 oktober 2018 heb ik geen druppel alcohol meer gedronken. Op eigen kracht, zonder hulp van buitenaf en ik heb doorgezet. En nu, na een paar jaar, kan ik met recht zeggen dat ik trots ben op mezelf! Ik heb bewust de keuze gemaakt om ook alles over mijn drankverleden openhartig op te schrijven. Ik weet dat mijn verhaal voor veel mensen met een alcoholprobleem herkenbaar zal zijn, en zij zich in veel situaties zullen herkennen. Voor hen hoop ik oprecht dat mijn verhaal een steuntje in de rug zal zijn zodat ook zij van hun verslaving afkomen. Maar ook neem ik jullie mee terug naar mijn jeugd in hartje Amsterdam, mijn kennismaking met mijn grote ontdekker Peter Koelewijn en de soms moeizame weg naar het succes. En natuurlijk de samenwerkingen en, vaak onvoorwaardelijke, vriendschappen met collega's als Gerard Joling en Benny Neyman. Maar ook mijn turbulente prive leven blijft niet onbesproken. De pijnlijke scheiding van mijn eerste man, het verdriet over enkele miskramen, en de relaties die ik had na mijn scheiding. Het huwelijk met mijn huidige man Anne Jan, het hernieuwde innige contact met mijn familie en de ziekenhuisopnames komen uitgebreid aan bod. Graag neem ik jullie mee in mijn leven vol ups en downs, een leven vol voor- en tegenspoed, maar vooral een leven vol respect voor anderen.

But now the firm is ready to tackle a case that could make the partners rich—without requiring them to actually practice much law. A class action suit has been brought against Varrick Labs, a pharmaceutical giant with annual sales of $25 billion, alleging that Krayoxx, its most popular drug, causes heart attacks.

1q84,['Haruki Murakami'],Atlas Contact,2011-02-18,"Boek drie is het derde deel uit de trilogie 1q84 ' Aomame kan niet weg uit de flat waar ze zich schuilhoudt, Tengo kan niet weg bij zijn stervende vader, en Ushikawa kan niet weg achter de verborgen camera waarmee hij op ze loert. Ieder bezint zich op zichzelf. Wat kunnen ze anders doen? Maar wie zal de eerste zijn die deze patstelling verbreekt? Wat is de werkelijke reden dat de sekte Aomame ten koste van alles levend in handen wil krijgen? En wie is de mysterieuze NHK-collecteur die bij alle drie op de voordeur bonst? In deze zinderende roman brengt Haruki Murakami zijn meesterlijke trilogie tot haar onverbiddelijke, ontroerende ontknoping. Boek drie is het derde deel uit de trilogie 1q84 Haruki Murakami (Kyoto, 1949) studeerde aan de Waseda-universiteit in Tokyo. Na zijn studie was Murakami zeven jaar eigenaar van een kleine jazzbar, Peter Cat, in Tokyo. Met zijn eerste roman Hear the wind sing (1979) won hij de Gunzou Literatuurprijs voor beginnende schrijvers. Deze roman vormt, samen met Pinball 1973 (1980) en De jacht op het verloren schaap de Trilogie van de Rat. Hear the wind sing en Pinball 1973 mochten niet buiten Japan worden verkocht, Murakami vond ze te zwak. Daarna schreef hij Hard-boiled Wonderland en het einde van de wereld, Norwegian Wood, Dans dans dans, Ten zuiden van de grens en De olifant verdwijnt. Vanaf 1991 woonde Murakami vier jaar met zijn vrouw in de Verenigde Staten, waar hij in Princeton (New Jersey) lesgaf en De opwindvogelkronieken schreef. Na de Hanshin-aardbeving in Kobe en de gasexplosie in de metro van Tokyo in 1995 keerde Murakami terug naar Japan, waar hij de slachtoffers van de gasexplosie en de leden van de religieuze sekte Aum Shinrikyo interviewde. Hij schreef vervolgens twee non-fictieboeken, die in 2000 zijn gebundeld in de Amerikaanse editie Underground. Sindsdien heeft Murakami Spoetnikliefde, Na de aardbeving en Kafka op het strand geschreven. De meest recente boeken zijn After Dark, Waarover ik praat als ik over hardlopen praat, de verhalenbundel Blinde wilg, slapende vrouw en 1q84 Boek een en Boek twee. Over 1q84 Boek een en Boek twee: Ik verwed er een parallel universum om dat u deze zomer geen vakantieboek zo briljant vinden zal. Bart Vanegeren, Humo **** Superieure spielerei in de nieuwe Murakami. [...] 1q84 is een fantasievol en spannend verhaal over een futuristisch Japans wonderland. De inhoud is mystiek, de vorm een superieur spel van stijlen. Elsevier Literaire sensatie van het jaar. Marnix Verplancke, De Morgen Murakami schreef het boek van het jaar [] Voor wie vandaag nog verlegen zit om een vakantieboek waar je echt je tanden in kunt zetten, is 1q84 een absolute aanrader: spannend maar ook diepzinnig, meeslepend maar toch soms dromerig, makkelijk verteld maar o zo zinderend en intens. Kortom, een weergaloze ode aan het geconcentreerde, zinnelijke leven. Knack Een meesterwerk. [...] Wachten met lezen van 1q84 tot deel 3 verschijnt wordt ten strengste afgeraden en zal leiden tot grote spijt. Het Parool 1q84 is beslist een Murakamiklassieker. [...] Lang na lezing blijft deze donkere droomwereld je bij en dat heeft absurd genoeg iets prettigs.

The Red Mist: A Tale of Civil Strife,['Randall Parrish'],Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,"IT WAS already growing dusk when the Staunton Battery of Horse Artillery returned wearily to camp after hours of hard field drill, the men ever conscious that no evolution, however trivial, was being overlooked by ""Stonewall"" Jackson, sitting astride his sorrel on a little eminence to the left, his stern face unrelieved by even the semblance of a smile. He would criticise without mercy, but never praise, and the artillerymen insensibly stiffened to the work, as eager to do well as though they were in action. The time was early spring, some remnants of snow still clinging to the hollows out of reach of the warming sun, and a chill wind blowing through the passes of the western mountains. The comparative idleness of the past winter months, given over to foraging and drill, together with the comforts of a permanent camp, had engendered forgetfulness of the hardships of the last campaign, and left the men eager to confront the dangers of the future. In no heart was there doubt of the final result—the Army of the Valley pinned its faith on ""Old Jack."" They were soldiers—veterans already—anxious for active service; their depleted ranks filled up once more with recruits, well drilled and efficient through constant training; and while many remembered with regret the old faces—the dead, the wounded, the missing—they nevertheless realized that never before were they in sterner mood or better prepared for grim fighting. The winter quarters of the Staunton Artillery were slightly off the main road, back within the shelter of a grove of oak trees, and I remained for some time overseeing the care of the horses before approaching the hut where the non-commissioned officers had mess. We were all of us still at the table, discussing the incidents of the drill, when a lieutenant appeared suddenly in the doorway, and glanced inquiringly about the room, scarcely able to distinguish our faces in the dull light of the lantern which alone illumined the interior.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781465614070'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1465614079'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",401.0,BOOK,['United States'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=97Y7DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=97Y7DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=97Y7DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:RED+MIST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=97Y7DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=97Y7DgAAQBAJ,,,,,

77 Shadow Street (with bonus novella The Moonlit Mind),['Dean Koontz'],Bantam,2011-12-27,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Welcome to the Pendleton. Built as a tycoon’s dream home in the 1880s and converted to luxury condominiums not quite a century later, the Gilded Age palace at the summit of Shadow Hill is a sanctuary for its fortunate residents. Scant traces remain of the episodes of madness, suicide, mass murder—and whispers of things far worse—that have scarred its grandeur almost from the beginning. But now inexplicable shadows caper across walls, security cameras relay impossible images, phantom voices mutter in strange tongues, not-quite-human figures lurk in the basement, elevators plunge into unknown depths. With each passing hour a terrifying certainty grows: Whatever drove the Pendleton’s past occupants to their unspeakable fates is at work again. And as nightmare visions become real, as a deadly tide begins to engulf them, the people at 77 Shadow Street will find the key to humanity’s future . . . if they can survive to use it. Includes the bonus novella The Moonlit Mind and an excerpt from Dean Koontz's The City.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345532367'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345532368'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",466.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.15.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=me-KZlVL1EYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=me-KZlVL1EYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=me-KZlVL1EYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:77+SHADOW+STREET&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=me-KZlVL1EYC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=me-KZlVL1EYC,4.0,10.0,A Novel,,
Death Comes to Pemberley,['P. D. James'],Knopf Canada,2011-11-03,"In a marvellous, thrilling re-creation of the world of Pride and Prejudice, P.D. James fuses the work of Jane Austen with her own great talent for writing crime fiction. The year is 1803, and Darcy and Elizabeth have been married for six years. There are now two handsome, healthy sons in the Pemberley nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband, Bingley, live within seventeen miles, the ordered and secure life of Pemberley seems unassailable, and Elizabeth's happiness in her marriage is complete. But their peace is threatened and old sins and misunderstandings are rekindled on the eve of the annual autumn ball. The Darcys and their guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland, and as it pulls up, Lydia Wickham, an uninvited guest, tumbles out, screaming that her husband has been murdered. Death Comes to Pemberley is a powerful work of fiction, rich in its compelling story, in its evocation of place, and its gripping psychological and emotional insight. James brings us back masterfully and with delight to much-loved characters, illuminating the happy but threatened marriage of the Darcys with the excitement and suspense of a brilliantly crafted mystery.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307362056'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307362051'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JDBBJjXPLb8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JDBBJjXPLb8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JDBBJjXPLb8C&dq=intitle:DEATH+COMES+TO+PEMBERLEY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JDBBJjXPLb8C&dq=intitle:DEATH+COMES+TO+PEMBERLEY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Death_Comes_to_Pemberley.html?hl=&id=JDBBJjXPLb8C,,,,,

Victims and Restorative Justice,"['Inge Vanfraechem', 'Daniela Bolívar Fernández', 'Ivo Aertsen']",Routledge,2015-05-15,"Restorative justice aims to address the consequences of crime by encouraging victims and offenders to communicate and discuss the harm caused by the crime that has been committed. In the majority of cases, restorative justice is facilitated by direct and indirect dialogue between victims and offenders, but it also includes support networks and sometimes involves professionals such as police, lawyers, social workers or prosecutors and judges. In theory, the victim is a core participant in restorative justice and the restoration of the harm is a first concern. In practice, questions arise as to whether the victim is actively involved in the process, what restoration may entail, whether there is a risk of secondary victimisation and whether the victim is truly at the heart of the restorative response, or whether the offender remains the focal point of attention. Using a combination of victimological literature and empirical data from a European research project, this book considers the role and the position of the victim in restorative justice practices, focusing on legislative, organisational and institutional frameworks of victim-offender mediation and conferencing programmes at a national and local level, as well as the victims’ personal needs and experiences. The findings are essential reading for academics and students engaged in the study of justice, victimology and law. The publication will also be valuable to policymakers and professionals such as social workers, lawyers and mediators.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781135092917'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1135092915'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",294.0,BOOK,['Social Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.2.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-JBhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-JBhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=-JBhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:VICTIMS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-JBhCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-JBhCQAAQBAJ,,,,,

Sacre Bleu,['Christopher Moore'],Harper Collins,2012-04-03,"“Christopher Moore is a very sick man, in the very best sense of that word.” —Carl Hiassen A magnificent “Comedy d’Art” from the author of Lamb, Fool, and Bite Me, Moore’s Sacré Bleu is part mystery, part history (sort of), part love story, and wholly hilarious as it follows a young baker-painter as he joins the dapper Henri Toulouse-Lautrec on a quest to unravel the mystery behind the supposed “suicide” of Vincent van Gogh. It is the color of the Virgin Mary's cloak, a dazzling pigment desired by artists, an exquisite hue infused with danger, adventure, and perhaps even the supernatural. It is . . . Sacré Bleu In July 1890, Vincent van Gogh went into a cornfield and shot himself. Or did he? Why would an artist at the height of his creative powers attempt to take his own life . . . and then walk a mile to a doctor's house for help? Who was the crooked little ""color man"" Vincent had claimed was stalking him across France? And why had the painter recently become deathly afraid of a certain shade of blue? These are just a few of the questions confronting Vincent's friends—baker-turned-painter Lucien Lessard and bon vivant Henri Toulouse-Lautrec—who vow to discover the truth about van Gogh's untimely death. Their quest will lead them on a surreal odyssey and brothel-crawl deep into the art world of late nineteenth-century Paris. Oh là là, quelle surprise, and zut alors! A delectable confection of intrigue, passion, and art history—with cancan girls, baguettes, and fine French cognac thrown in for good measure—Sacré Bleu is another masterpiece of wit and wonder from the one, the only, Christopher Moore.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062101242'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062101242'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",432.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=92uUv6d3gRwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=92uUv6d3gRwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=92uUv6d3gRwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SACR%C3%89+BLEU&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=92uUv6d3gRwC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=92uUv6d3gRwC,3.5,18.0,A Comedy d'Art,,

Mission to Paris,['Alan Furst'],Hachette UK,2012-06-14,"The author of TV Book Club's SPIES OF THE BALKANS returns with a hugely evocative thriller set in wartime Paris. Frederic Stahl, born of Viennese intelligentsia, ran away to sea at the age of seventeen. Embarking in America, his matinee idol looks and Old-World charm took him to Hollywood, and a life of movies and women. But by autumn 1939, the unease in Europe has spread even to Stahl's glamorous enclave. War has been declared, and though bullets and bombs are yet to fly, his decision to shoot a film in Paris seems ill-advised. The Parisians know this is their last spring and a time to be passionate. Soon after his arrival, Stahl is drawn into a clandestine world of foreign correspondents, exiled Spanish republicans and, of course, spies of every sort. For as a celebrity from neutral America - who can travel across the continent freely - Stahl could be very useful indeed ...

The Fallen Angel Man,['Augustus M Brown II'],Page Publishing Inc,2021-02-15,"People are suffering here in America and abroad. Global warming, mass conflicts, increased domestic and foreign murders, governmental corruptions, starving nations, global wars coupled with global warming, the consciousness of the men attempting to turn into women, and the consciousness of the woman falling from her place to be as a man, all of these are threats against our survival of tomorrow. Wars are now fought with computerized drones overseas. Drugs, gangs, killings, police shooting coupled with political protection are ravishing the land of equal rights under the symbol of the eagle. These are biblical signs of the realities of the problems and conditions that should tell us all something is very wrong. The major questions are, can the human race avoid self-destruction? And if so, does our salvation rest in relying on a higher power to insure future generations have a world that’s worth living in under the laws of man? For too long we the human family have collectively functioned like lost children, but, some as prodigal sons, even as fallen angels. However, our earthly existence isn’t random coincidences, for it is not, all of these conditions of the man that’s upon this earth are a one chance to learn and understand what it is to live in equality under the original orders and commandments of God the creator and those of Jesus Christ the savior of all men. Personally, I believe that God is humanity’s best hope for survival. The book’s title The Fallen Angel Man – Egairram, Not Marriage, essentially refers to mankind’s disconnect from his creator. Within its pages you see vivid examples of, among other things, our moral decadences, and I’d dare say that only a willingly blind person would fail to see the consequences all around us from a severed spiritual bond. So whether you believe in divine solutions, or you prefer a more “common sense” approach to fixing society’s problems in playing eternal death roulette, feel free to criticize these books. Even disagree with some of the subject material as presented.

Notorious Nineteen,['Janet Evanovich'],Bantam,2012-11-20,"#1 bestselling author Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum novels are: “irresistible” (Houston Chronicle), “stunning” (Booklist), “outrageous” (Publishers Weekly), “brilliantly evocative” (The Denver Post), and “making trouble and winning hearts” (USA Today). New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is certain of three truths: People don’t just vanish into thin air. Never anger old people. And don’t do what Tiki tells you to do. After a slow summer of chasing low-level skips for her cousin Vinnie’s bail bonds agency, Stephanie Plum finally lands an assignment that could put her checkbook back in the black. Geoffrey Cubbin, facing trial for embezzling millions from Trenton’s premier assisted-living facility, has mysteriously vanished from the hospital after an emergency appendectomy. Now it’s on Stephanie to track him down. Unfortunately, Cubbin has disappeared without a trace, a witness, or his money-hungry wife. Rumors are stirring that he must have had help with the daring escape . . . or that maybe he never made it out of his room alive. Since the hospital staff’s lips seem to be tighter than the security, and it’s hard for Stephanie to blend in to assisted living, Stephanie’s Grandma Mazur goes in undercover. But when a second felon goes missing from the same hospital, Stephanie is forced into working side by side with Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, in order to crack the case. The real problem is, no Cubbin also means no way to pay the rent. Desperate for money—or maybe just desperate—Stephanie accepts a secondary job guarding her secretive and mouthwatering mentor Ranger from a deadly Special Forces adversary. While Stephanie is notorious for finding trouble, she may have found a little more than she bargained for this time around. Then again—a little food poisoning, some threatening notes, and a bridesmaid’s dress with an excess of taffeta never killed anyone . . . or did they? If Stephanie Plum wants to bring in a paycheck, she’ll have to remember: No guts, no glory.

THE FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF INDIA,['Arun Anand'],Prabhat Prakashan,2021-11-29,"It was a court battle between the first Prime Minister of India Jawahar Lal Nehru and Organiser, an English weekly backed by the RSS that led to restrictions on freedom of expression which we are debating today.

Did you know that one single anti-India and pro-China book ‘India’s China War’ written by Anglo-Australian journalist Neville Maxwell shaped the global narrative against India for more than five decades. It was a Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner who challenged it and turned the tables on Chinese propaganda with his book ‘China’s India War’ but even Indians don’t talk about it. Everyone remembers the 1962 war when India lost to China but there was another war in 1967 on Sikkim border where India took the revenge of 1967 and defeated China.

Tenth of December,['George Saunders'],Random House,2013-01-08,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST • NAMED ONE OF TIME’S TEN BEST FICTION BOOKS OF THE DECADE • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE DECADE BY ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY AND BUZZFEED • NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY People • The New York Times Magazine • NPR • Entertainment Weekly • New York • The Telegraph • BuzzFeed • Kirkus Reviews • BookPage • Shelf Awareness Includes an extended conversation with David Sedaris One of the most important and blazingly original writers of his generation, George Saunders is an undisputed master of the short story, and Tenth of December is his most honest, accessible, and moving collection yet. In the taut opener, “Victory Lap,” a boy witnesses the attempted abduction of the girl next door and is faced with a harrowing choice: Does he ignore what he sees, or override years of smothering advice from his parents and act? In “Home,” a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antiques store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of Tenth of December are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders’s signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation. Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience. These stories take on the big questions and explore the fault lines of our own morality, delving into the questions of what makes us good and what makes us human. Unsettling, insightful, and hilarious, the stories in Tenth of December—through their manic energy, their focus on what is redeemable in human beings, and their generosity of spirit—not only entertain and delight; they fulfill Chekhov’s dictum that art should “prepare us for tenderness.” GEORGE SAUNDERS WAS NAMED ONE OF THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BY TIME MAGAZINE","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812993813'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0812993810'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",208.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.16.19.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T8HCsVVqcHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T8HCsVVqcHcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=T8HCsVVqcHcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TENTH+OF+DECEMBER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T8HCsVVqcHcC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T8HCsVVqcHcC,2.0,1.0,Stories,,

Yasuko Hanaoka is a divorced, single mother who thought she had finally escaped her abusive ex-husband Togashi. When he shows up one day to extort money from her, threatening both her and her teenaged daughter Misato, the situation quickly escalates into violence and Togashi ends up dead on her apartment floor.

Lover At Last,['J.R. Ward'],Penguin,2013-03-26,"“The hottest collection of studs in romance” (New York Times Bestselling Author Angela Knight) returns as J. R. Ward brings together two of the most beloved people in the Black Dagger Brotherhood world—at last.... Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has found an identity as a brutal fighter in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another.... Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it’s about time: it seems Qhuinn has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young. It’s hard for Blay to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. And Qhuinn needs to come to terms with some dark things before he can move forward… Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions, but as the battle over the race’s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn learns the true meaning of courage, and two hearts meant to be together finally become one.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101607718'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1101607718'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",610.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.10.11.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBOMoQrGGpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rBOMoQrGGpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=rBOMoQrGGpsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:LOVER+AT+LAST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBOMoQrGGpsC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rBOMoQrGGpsC,4.0,4.0,A Novel of the Black Dagger Brotherhood,,
The Burgess Boys,['Elizabeth Strout'],Random House,2013-03-26,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “What truly makes Strout exceptional . . . is the perfect balance she achieves between the tides of story and depths of feeling.”—Chicago Tribune This edition includes an original essay by Elizabeth Strout about the origins of The Burgess Boys. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post • NPR • Good Housekeeping Haunted by the freak accident that killed their father when they were children, Jim and Bob Burgess escaped from their Maine hometown of Shirley Falls for New York City as soon as they possibly could. Jim, a sleek, successful corporate lawyer, has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives, and Bob, a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim, has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister, Susan—the Burgess sibling who stayed behind—urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son, Zach, has gotten himself into a world of trouble, and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood, where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever. With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling, exquisite prose, and remarkable insight into character, Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page. Tender, tough-minded, loving, and deeply illuminating about the ties that bind us to family and home, The Burgess Boys is perhaps Elizabeth Strout’s most astonishing work of literary art.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812984613'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0812984617'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",354.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,4.14.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UjEGmoJ2Q7sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UjEGmoJ2Q7sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=UjEGmoJ2Q7sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+BURGESS+BOYS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UjEGmoJ2Q7sC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UjEGmoJ2Q7sC,3.5,2.0,A Novel,,

Deeply Odd,['Dean Koontz'],Bantam,2013-05-28,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The pistol appeared in his hand the way a dove appears in the hand of a good magician, as if it materialized out of thin air. “You think I won’t do it right here in the open. But you’d be surprised. . . . You’ll drop before you get the breath to scream.” The truck driver is decked out like a rhinestone cowboy, only instead of a guitar he’s slinging a gun—and Odd Thomas is on the wrong end of the barrel. Though he narrowly dodges a bullet, Odd can’t outrun the shocking vision burned into his mind . . . or the destiny that will drive him into a harrowing showdown with absolute evil. DEEPLY ODD How do you make sure a crime that hasn’t happened yet, never does? That’s the critical question facing Odd Thomas, the young man with a unique ability to commune with restless spirits and help them find justice and peace. But this time, it’s the living who desperately need Odd on their side. Three helpless innocents will be brutally executed unless Odd can intervene in time. Who the potential victims are and where they can be found remain a mystery. The only thing Odd knows for sure is who the killer will be: the homicidal stranger who tried to shoot him dead in a small-town parking lot. With the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock riding shotgun and a network of unlikely allies providing help along the way, Odd embarks on an interstate game of cat and mouse with his sinister quarry. He will soon learn that his adversary possesses abilities that may surpass his own and operates in service to infinitely more formidable foes, with murder a mere prelude to much deeper designs. Traveling across a landscape haunted by portents of impending catastrophe, Odd will do what he must and go where his path leads him, drawing ever closer to the dark heart of his long journey—and, perhaps, to the bright light beyond. Praise for Deeply Odd and Dean Koontz’s Odd Thomas series “Not since Watchers has Dean Koontz created such an endearing and enduring character as Odd Thomas. . . . One of our contemporary masters.”—San Antonio Express-News “[A] popular series . . . Koontz asks real questions about the nature of good and evil.”—The New York Times Book Review “Odd evokes the homespun wisdom of Forrest Gump amid the mind-spinning adventures of a Jack Bauer. . . . The ultimate Everyman . . . an avatar of hope and honor and courage for all of us—the linchpin of a rollicking good tale.”—BookPage “There’s never anything predictable about an Odd Thomas adventure. Another satisfying entry in this wildly popular series. It’s Koontz, and it’s Odd.

Now Macomber returns to the charming Rose Harbor Inn, where each guest finds a second chance and every room comes with an inspiring new view. Since moving to Cedar Cove, Jo Marie Rose has truly started to feel at home, and her neighbors have become her closest friends. Now it’s springtime, and Jo Marie is eager to finish the most recent addition to her inn. In memory of her late husband, Paul, she has designed a beautiful rose garden for the property and enlisted handyman Mark Taylor to help realize it. She and Mark don’t always see eye-to-eye—and at times he seems far removed—yet deep down, Jo Marie finds great comfort in his company. And while she still seeks a sense of closure, she welcomes her latest guests, who are on their own healing journeys. Annie Newton arrives in town to orchestrate her grandparents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary celebration. While Annie is excited for the festivities, she’s struggling to move on from her broken engagement, and her grandparents themselves seem to be having trouble getting along. Worse, Annie is forced to see Oliver Sutton, with whom she grew up and who has always mercilessly teased her. But the best parties end with a surprise, and Annie is in for the biggest one of all. High-powered businesswoman Mary Smith, another Rose Harbor Inn guest, has achieved incredible success in her field, yet serious illness has led her to face her sole, lingering regret. Almost nineteen years ago, she ended her relationship with her true love, George Hudson, and now she’s returned to Cedar Cove to make amends. Compassion and joy await Jo Marie, Annie, and Mary as they make peace with their pasts and look boldly toward their futures. Rose Harbor in Bloom is Debbie Macomber at her heartwarming best.

But shadows are falling on the usually festive season for Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. Most of his best agents have left the Homicide Department, his old friend and lieutenant Jean-Guy Beauvoir hasn't spoken to him in months, and hostile forces are lining up against him. When Gamache receives a message from Myrna Landers that a longtime friend has failed to arrive for Christmas in the village of Three Pines, he welcomes the chance to get away from the city. Mystified by Myrna's reluctance to reveal her friend's name, Gamache soon discovers the missing woman was once one of the most famous people not just in North America, but in the world, and now goes unrecognized by virtually everyone except the mad, brilliant poet Ruth Zardo. As events come to a head, Gamache is drawn ever deeper into the world of Three Pines. Increasingly, he is not only investigating the disappearance of Myrna's friend but also seeking a safe place for himself and his still-loyal colleagues.

W Is for Wasted,['Sue Grafton'],,2014-08-14,"Two dead men changed the course of my life that fall. One of them I knew and the other I'd never laid eyes on until I saw him in the morgue. The first was a local PI of suspect reputation. He'd been gunned down near the beach at Santa Teresa. It looked like a robbery gone bad. The other was on the beach six weeks later. He'd been sleeping rough. Probably homeless. No identification. A slip of paper with Private Investigator Kinsey Millhone's name and number was in his pants pocket. The coroner asked her to come to the morgue to see if she could ID him. Two seemingly unrelated deaths, one a murder, the other apparently of natural causes. But as Kinsey digs deeper into the mystery of the John Doe, some very strange links begin to emerge. And before long at least one aspect is solved as Kinsey finds the key to his identity . . . In this multilayered tale, the surfaces seem clear, but the underpinnings are full of betrayals, misunderstandings, and outright murderous fraud. And Kinsey, through no fault of her own, is thoroughly compromised . . .","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '033051279X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780330512794'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['Detective and mystery stories'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,,"{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1pLsngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1pLsngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1pLsngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:%E2%80%9CW%E2%80%9D+IS+FOR+WASTED&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1pLsngEACAAJ&dq=intitle:%E2%80%9CW%E2%80%9D+IS+FOR+WASTED&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/W_Is_for_Wasted.html?hl=&id=1pLsngEACAAJ,,,,,
The Longest Ride,['Nicholas Sparks'],Hachette UK,2013-09-17,"From the dark days of WWII to present-day North Carolina, this New York Times bestseller shares the lives of two couples overcoming destructive secrets -- and finding joy together. Ira Levinson is in trouble. Ninety-one years old and stranded and injured after a car crash, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together - how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can't possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage. A few miles away, at a local bull-riding event, a Wake Forest College senior's life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death - loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he's keeping doesn't destroy it first. Ira and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781455520664'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1455520667'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",422.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,0.28.29.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dotlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dotlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dotlAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+LONGEST+RIDE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dotlAgAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LONGEST+RIDE&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Longest_Ride.html?hl=&id=dotlAgAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,,,

Now, Dan has finally found some order in the chaos by working in a local hospice, earning the nickname “Doctor Sleep” by secretly using his special abilities to comfort the dying and prepare them for the afterlife.

The Lowland,['Jhumpa Lahiri'],A&C Black,2013-01-01,"SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2013. From Subhash's earliest memories, at every point, his brother was there. In the suburban streets of Calcutta where they wandered before dusk and in the hyacinth-strewn ponds where they played for hours on end, Udayan was always in his older brother's sight.So close in age, they were inseparable in childhood and yet, as the years pass - as U.S tanks roll into Vietnam and riots sweep across India - their brotherly bond can do nothing to forestall the tragedy that will upend their lives. Udayan - charismatic and impulsive - finds himself drawn to the Naxalite movement, a rebellion waged to eradicate inequity and poverty. He will give everything, risk all, for what he believes, and in doing so will transform the futures of those dearest to him: his newly married, pregnant wife, his brother and their parents. For all of them, the repercussions of his actions will reverberate across continents and seep through the generations that follow.Epic in its canvas and intimate in its portrayal of lives undone and forged anew, The Lowland is a deeply felt novel of family ties that entangle and fray in ways unforeseen and unrevealed, of ties that ineluctably define who we are. With all the hallmarks of Jhumpa Lahiri's achingly poignant, exquisitely empathetic story-telling, this is her most devastating work of fiction to date.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781408828113'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1408828111'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",354.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZfJdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZfJdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZfJdAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+LOWLAND&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZfJdAAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+LOWLAND&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Lowland.html?hl=&id=ZfJdAAAAQBAJ,,,,,

The Mirage,['محفوظ، نجيب،'],American Univ in Cairo Press,2009,"A psychological study of the first order with a subtly Freudian flavor, The Mirage is the autobiographical account of Kamil Ru'ba, a tortured soul who finds himself struggling unduly to cope with life's challenges. The internal torment and angst that dog him throughout his life and the tragic, ironic turns of events that overtake him as a young man are, to a great extent, the outworkings of his faulty upbringing. At the same time, they work together to drive home the novel's underlying theme: the illusory, undependable nature of the world in which we live and the call to seek, beyond the outward and the ephemeral, that which is inward and enduring. The narrative, full of pathos, draws the reader unwittingly into a vicarious experience of Kamil's agonies and ecstasies.

The Impact of Desert Dust Across the Mediterranean,"['Stefano Guerzoni', 'R. Chester']",Springer Science & Business Media,2013-04-17,"The atmosphere is an important pathway for the transport of continentally-derived material to the oceans. In this respect the Mediterranean Sea is of special importance because its atmosphere receives inputs of anthropogenic aerosols from the north and desert- derived Saharan dusts from the south. The dusts, much of which is transported in the form of seasonal `pulses', have important effects on climate, marine chemistry and sedimentation in the Mediterranean Sea. This volume brings together reviews and specific-topic papers on the following aspects of Saharan dust transport to the Mediterranean Sea: (i) the modelling of Saharan dust transport, (ii) the chemistry and mineralogy of the dusts and their effect on precipitation, (iii) the contribution of the dusts to marine sedimentation, (iv) the aerobiology of the dusts, and (v) climatic implications of Saharan dust transport. The volume is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the climate, biogeochemistry and geology of the Mediterranean Sea.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789401733540'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9401733546'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",390.0,BOOK,['Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.1.1.0.preview.1,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kEPsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kEPsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=kEPsCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DUST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kEPsCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kEPsCAAAQBAJ,,,,,
Takedown Twenty,['Janet Evanovich'],Bantam,2013-11-19,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Powerhouse author Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum novels are “as entertaining as ever” (Entertainment Weekly), “brilliantly evocative” (The Denver Post), and “making trouble and winning hearts” (USA Today). Stephanie Plum has her sights set on catching a notorious mob boss. If she doesn’t take him down, he may take her out. New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum knows better than to mess with family. But when powerful mobster Salvatore “Uncle Sunny” Sunucchi goes on the lam in Trenton, it’s up to Stephanie to find him. Uncle Sunny is charged with murder for running over a guy (twice), and nobody wants to turn him in—not his poker buddies, not his bimbo girlfriend, not his two right-hand men, Shorty and Moe. Even Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, has skin in the game, because—just Stephanie’s luck—the godfather is his actual godfather. And while Morelli understands that the law is the law, his old-world grandmother, Bella, is doing everything she can to throw Stephanie off the trail. It’s not just Uncle Sunny giving Stephanie the run-around. Security specialist Ranger needs her help to solve the bizarre death of a top client’s mother, a woman who happened to play bingo with Stephanie’s Grandma Mazur. Before Stephanie knows it, she’s working side by side with Ranger and Grandma at the senior center, trying to catch a killer on the loose—and the bingo balls are not rolling in their favor. With bullet holes in her car, henchmen on her tail, and a giraffe named Kevin running wild in the streets of Trenton, Stephanie will have to up her game for the ultimate takedown.

The Invention of Wings,['Sue Monk Kidd'],Hachette UK,2014-01-07,"The No. 1 New York Times bestseller. A powerful and extraordinary novel about the unlikely friendship between two exceptional women during the last years of slavery in the US. From the celebrated author of the multi-million-copy-bestselling novel The Secret Life of Bees. 'Fascinating... A splendid tribute to a pair of true heroines' The Times 'Wonderful - well-written, moving and engaging by turns, and always compelling' Daily Mail 'A remarkable novel that heightened my sense of what it meant to be a woman - slave or free' Oprah Winfrey 'A resonant, illuminating novel' Observer Sarah Grimké is the middle daughter. Her mother says she's difficult and her father says she's remarkable. On Sarah's eleventh birthday, Hetty 'Handful' Grimké is taken from the slave quarters she shares with her mother, wrapped in lavender ribbons, and presented to Sarah as a gift. Sarah knows that what she does next will unleash a world of trouble. She also knows that she cannot accept another person as a present. And so, indeed, the trouble begins ... A powerful, sweeping novel, inspired by real events, and set in the American Deep South in the nineteenth century, The Invention of Wings evokes a world of shocking contrasts, of beauty and ugliness, of otherwise respectable people living daily with cruelty they fail to recognise; and celebrates the power of friendship and sisterhood against all the odds. What readers say about The Invention of Wings: 'You cannot fault Sue Monk Kidd's writing; she very adeptly speaks with both Sarah and Handful's voice.

K van killer,['Sue Grafton'],Lindhardt og Ringhof,2021-11-05,"Het leven van Janice Kepler verandert in een regelrechte nachtmerrie. Het levenloze lichaam van haar dochter Lorna wordt in het bos gevonden en is al zo ver ontbonden dat ze de oorzaak van haar dood niet meer kunnen vaststellen. Was het een ongeluk? Zelfmoord? Of toch moord? Met deze prangende onzekerheid moet Janice nog iedere dag leven. Maar ze is ervan overtuigd dat iemand haar heeft vermoord en de gedachte dat deze persoon nog vrij rondloopt, kan ze niet langer aan. Privédetective Kinsey Millhone begint een onderzoek naar de dood van Lorna om haar moeder de rust te geven die ze verdient. Wat is er met haar gebeurd? Heeft Lorna's eigenzinnige karakter haar in de problemen gebracht? ‘K van killer’ is het elfde boek in de populaire Alfabetreeks van New York Times-bestsellerauteur Sue Grafton, met de eigenwijze Kinsey Millhone in de hoofdrol. ""Grafton exhibits a sharp ear for dialogue and a quarter-horse pace. Her characters are as real as any this side of Elmore Leonard. 'K' is for Killer offers further proof of Grafton's growth as a writer. This is one mystery series that gains strength with each passing letter."" —Lorenzo Carcaterm, People Magazine ""Unlike many detective series, Grafton's seems only to get better each time out. How comforting that she's got fifteen letters left to play with."" —Gene Lyons, Entertainment Weekly 'K' is for Killer is the most ambitious and perhaps the best yet of these popular 'alphabetical mysteries'...A book that takes this fine series to a new level of seriousness and accomplishment."" —Tom Nolan, Wall Street Journal Sue Grafton (1940 - 2017) was een beroemde Amerikaanse detectiveschrijfster. Haar populaire Alfabetreeks, die in 1982 begon met ‘A van alibi’, werd wereldwijd een hit. Het was ten tijde van de eerste publicatie bijzonder dat een vrouwelijke detective de hoofdrol had. In de reeks volgt Graftons miljoenenpubliek privédetective Kinsey Millhone die moordzaken probeert op te lossen. Vlak voor haar overlijden in 2017 kwam de laatste misdaadroman in de reeks uit: ‘Y staat voor...’, waarmee Graftons moordalfabet eindigt met de letter Y. De New York Times-bestsellerauteur heeft het hoofdpersonage Kinsey op haar eigen alter ego gebaseerd, een versie van zichzelf als ze niet jong was getrouwd en geen kinderen had gehad. Haar boeken zijn in 29 landen uitgegeven. Bovendien won de schrijfster, naast vele andere prijzen, de Anthony Best Novel Award maar liefst drie keer.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9788726879124'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '8726879123'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",357.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],MATURE,False,1.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=quFJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=quFJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=quFJEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:KILLER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=quFJEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=quFJEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

Missing the Child You Love,['H. Norman DMin Wright'],Baker Books,2014-04-18,"One of the most devastating losses a family can experience is the loss of a child. Whether the loss is through illness, accident, drugs, suicide, or other tragedy, the pain is overwhelming and often paralyzing. Often we think of ""loss"" as death. However, in our broken world there are many ways to suffer the loss of a child. This book discusses how a family can learn to cope with loss of a child due not only to death, but also to a custody battle, addiction (and other choices a child makes), chronic illness, crime (human trafficking, kidnap), and other issues where hopes and dreams disappear. Wright helps readers through the grieving process and assists them in finding God's grace and comfort during this very difficult time of life.

The King's Assassin,['Benjamin Woolley'],St. Martin's Press,2018-07-17,"An absorbing account of the conspiracy to kill King James I by his handsome lover, the Duke of Buckingham, an historical crime that has remained hidden for 400 years. The rise of George Villiers from minor gentry to royal power seemed to defy gravity. Becoming gentleman of the royal bedchamber in 1615, the young gallant enraptured James, Britain’s first Stuart king, royal adoration reaching such an intensity that the king declared he wanted the courtier to become his ‘wife’. For a decade, Villiers was at the king’s side – at court, on state occasions, and in bed, right up to James’s death in March 1625. Almost immediately, Villiers’ many enemies accused him of poisoning the king. A parliamentary investigation was launched, and scurrilous pamphlets and ballads circulated London’s streets. But the charges came to nothing, and were relegated to a historical footnote. Now, new research suggests that a deadly combination of hubris and vulnerability did indeed drive Villiers to kill the man who made him. It may have been by accident – the application of a quack remedy while the king was weakened by a malarial attack. But there is compelling evidence that Villiers, overcome by ambition and frustrated by James’s passive approach to government, poisoned him. In The King’s Assassin, acclaimed author Benjamin Woolley examines this remarkable, even tragic story. Combining vivid characterization and a strong narrative with historical scholarship and forensic investigation, Woolley tells the story of King James’s death, and of the captivating figure at its center.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250125057'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250125057'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1BpFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1BpFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1BpFDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+KING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=1BpFDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+KING&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_King_s_Assassin.html?hl=&id=1BpFDwAAQBAJ,,,The Secret Plot to Murder King James I,,

Penn Cage is caught in the darkest maelstrom of his life. The death of his father's African-American nurse has fractured Penn's family and turned Dr. Tom Cage into a fugitive.

Lindsay and Conklin learn more about their victims. Lara Timble was a graduate student studying music. David Klatz, the driver of the vehicle, was working on his postgraduate in psychology. Neither victim had any political involvement or known enemies to suggest a suspect for the crime.Due to the nature of the crime, the FBI quickly comes in and takes over the case. With that, there is limited evidence available to the detectives which point to any kind of perpetrator and they have yet to even figure out what kind of bomb was used or how it was implanted in the victims' stomachs.It is at this point that readers get their first glimpse of Lindsay's home life. Her husband, daughter, and pet dog are introduced and we see that Lindsay is a loving wife and mother who enjoys the time she gets to spend at home. However, Lindsay is also cautious and worries about the safety of her family. This acts as foreshadowing to the fact that her family will be a vulnerable point and a source of weakness for Lindsay as she hunts down dangerous killers who take up personal vendettas against her.Here Is A Preview Of What You'll Learn When You Download Your Copy Today• General Overview and Summary of Unlucky 13• Characters From Unlucky 13 • Analysis of Unlucky 13• Subplots from Unlucky 13 Download Your Copy Today!

Skin in the Game,['Nassim Nicholas Taleb'],Random House,2018-02-27,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A bold work from the author of The Black Swan that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life. As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights: • For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations. • Ethical rules aren’t universal. You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general. • Minorities, not majorities, run the world. The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others. • You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets. • Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find). A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines. • True religion is commitment, not just faith. How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it. The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780425284636'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0425284638'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",305.0,BOOK,['Philosophy'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.11.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4dQ0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4dQ0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4dQ0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SKIN+GAME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4dQ0DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:SKIN+GAME&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Skin_in_the_Game.html?hl=&id=4dQ0DwAAQBAJ,,,Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life,,

Lost Island,,,2017,"From a New York Times-bestselling author: An island off the Georgia coast holds the memory of a broken heart and the secrets of a woman's past. It's been years since Lacey Ames last saw Hampton Island, where she grew up amid the sandy marshes with her childhood sweetheart, Giles Severn, and her cousin Elise-and where Elise had stolen the man Lacey loved. Lacey never forgot the hurt and betrayal she once suffered at Giles's grand family home of Sea Oaks, but a curious and compelling summons from Elise prompts her return. Once Lacey arrives, she realizes how little has changed. Giles is still the handsome charmer she fell in love with, and Elise is still the wily seductress whose succession of lovers has risked a family scandal. But when a series of anonymous harmless pranks turns threatening, Lacey must finally confront the past-and a decade-old secret from one haunting summer at Sea Oaks.

Love Letters: Vita and Virginia,"['Vita Sackville-West', 'Virginia Woolf']",Random House,2021-02-04,"Delve into a legendary literary love affair 'I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia. I composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night, and it has all gone. I just miss you...' At a dinner party in 1922, Virginia Woolf met the renowned author, aristocrat - and sapphist - Vita Sackville-West. Virginia wrote in her diary that she didn't think much of Vita's conversation, but she did think very highly of her legs. It was to be the start of almost twenty years of flirtation, friendship, and literary collaboration. Their correspondence ended only with Virginia's death in 1941. Intimate and playful, these selected letters and diary entries allow us to hear these women's constantly changing feelings for each other in their own words. Eavesdrop on the affair that inspired Virginia to write her most fantastical novel, Orlando, and discover a relationship that - even a hundred years later - feels radical and relatable.

The Sixth Extinction,['Elizabeth Kolbert'],Henry Holt and Company,2014-02-11,"ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR A major book about the future of the world, blending intellectual and natural history and field reporting into a powerful account of the mass extinction unfolding before our eyes Over the last half a billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In The Sixth Extinction, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780805099799'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0805099794'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",336.0,BOOK,['Nature'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.17.16.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+6TH+EXTINCTION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ,4.0,5.0,An Unnatural History,,

Somewhere Safe with Somebody Good,['Jan Karon'],Penguin,2014-09-02,"#1 New York Times bestselling author Jan Karon welcomes you back home to Mitford in this inspirational novel that “hits the sweet spot at the intersection of your heart and your funny bone” (USA Today). After five hectic years of retirement from Lord’s Chapel, Father Tim Kavanagh returns with his wife, Cynthia, from the land of his Irish ancestors. While he’s glad to be at home in Mitford, something is definitely missing from his life: a pulpit. But when he’s offered one, he decides he doesn’t want it. For years, he believed he had a few answers. Now he has questions. How can he possibly help Dooley’s younger brother, Sammy, make it through the fallout of a disasterous childhood? Could doing a good deed for the town bookstore be the best thing for his befuddled spirit? And who was riding through town in a limo? Not Edith Mallory. Then an editorial in the weekly Muse poses a question that sets the whole town looking for answers: Does Mitford still take care of its own?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698141407'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698141407'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",528.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.10.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cxp0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cxp0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cxp0AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SOMEWHERE+SAFE+WITH+SOMEBODY+GOOD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cxp0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cxp0AwAAQBAJ,,,The New Mitford Novel,,
The Bone Clocks,['David Mitchell'],Random House,2014-09-02,"The New York Times bestseller by the author of Cloud Atlas • Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize • Named One of the Top Ten Fiction Books of the Year by Time, Entertainment Weekly, and O: The Oprah Magazine • A New York Times Notable Book • An American Library Association Notable Book • Winner of the World Fantasy Award “With The Bone Clocks, [David] Mitchell rises to meet and match the legacy of Cloud Atlas.”—Los Angeles Times Following a terrible fight with her mother over her boyfriend, fifteen-year-old Holly Sykes slams the door on her family and her old life. But Holly is no typical teenage runaway: A sensitive child once contacted by voices she knew only as “the radio people,” Holly is a lightning rod for psychic phenomena. Now, as she wanders deeper into the English countryside, visions and coincidences reorder her reality until they assume the aura of a nightmare brought to life. For Holly has caught the attention of a cabal of dangerous mystics—and their enemies. But her lost weekend is merely the prelude to a shocking disappearance that leaves her family irrevocably scarred. This unsolved mystery will echo through every decade of Holly’s life, affecting all the people Holly loves—even the ones who are not yet born. A Cambridge scholarship boy grooming himself for wealth and influence, a conflicted father who feels alive only while reporting on the war in Iraq, a middle-aged writer mourning his exile from the bestseller list—all have a part to play in this surreal, invisible war on the margins of our world. From the medieval Swiss Alps to the nineteenth-century Australian bush, from a hotel in Shanghai to a Manhattan townhouse in the near future, their stories come together in moments of everyday grace and extraordinary wonder. Rich with character and realms of possibility, The Bone Clocks is a kaleidoscopic novel that begs to be taken apart and put back together by a writer The Washington Post calls “the novelist who’s been showing us the future of fiction.” An elegant conjurer of interconnected tales, a genre-bending daredevil, and a master prose stylist, David Mitchell has become one of the leading literary voices of his generation. His hypnotic new novel, The Bone Clocks, crackles with invention and wit and sheer storytelling pleasure—it is fiction at its most spellbinding.

It's Christmas-time in New York City, but homicide lieutenant Eve Dallas struggles to get into the holiday spirit. Finding a woman strangled to death by a murderous Santa doesn't help. And he's left behind a present: a partridge in a pear tree, pinned to the victim's hair. With a creeping dread, Eve watches the bodies mount and realises the key - the killer is counting down the twelve days to Christmas. And there is only one connection.

In beide opvattingen schuilt waarheid. Medisch gesproken zijn er geen indicatoren die van burn-out een ziekte maken. Toch ervaren veel mensen vandaag een reële uitputting, en wijst het fenomeen op een maatschappelijk probleem. Daar eindigen de tegenstrijdigheden niet: experts en therapeuten geraken het niet eens over een definitie, en gaan aan de slag met tegenstrijdige omschrijvingen. Hoe krijgen we vat op dit ongrijpbare fenomeen? De burn-outparadox verscherpt ons beeld van het hedendaagse burn-out-begrip, precies door haar vergeten verleden in kaart te brengen.

Leaving Time (with bonus novella Larger Than Life),['Jodi Picoult'],Ballantine Books,2014-10-14,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A deeply moving, gripping, and intelligent page-turner about a daughter’s search for her mother, Leaving Time is Jodi Picoult at the height of her powers. Includes the novella Larger Than Life Throughout her blockbuster career, Jodi Picoult has seamlessly blended nuanced characters, riveting plots, and rich prose, brilliantly creating stories that “not only provoke the mind but touch the flawed souls in all of us” (The Boston Globe). Now, in Leaving Time, she has delivered a book unlike anything she’s written before. For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice’s old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother’s whereabouts. Desperate to find the truth, Jenna enlists two unlikely allies in her quest: Serenity Jones, a psychic who rose to fame finding missing persons, only to later doubt her gifts, and Virgil Stanhope, the jaded private detective who’d originally investigated Alice’s case along with the strange, possibly linked death of one of her colleagues. As the three work together to uncover what happened to Alice, they realize that in asking hard questions, they’ll have to face even harder answers. As Jenna’s memories dovetail with the events in her mother’s journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish. Praise for Leaving Time “Piercing and uplifting . . . a smart, accessible yarn with a suspenseful puzzle at its core.”—The Boston Globe “Poignant . . . an entertaining tale about parental love, friendship, loss.”—The Washington Post “A riveting drama.”—Us Weekly “[A] moving tale.”—People “A fast-paced, surprise-ending mystery.”—USA Today “In Jenna, [Jodi] Picoult has created an unforgettable character who will easily endear herself to each and every reader. . . .

Recently sent to prison for burglary, he knows that his four year sentence means that he will miss the birth of his first child. With his wife's due date fast approaching, he had hoped that the prison authorities would allow him to be present for the birth, but they have said no. Sharing a cell with Colin is Barry Marsden. Unlike most of the inmates, Barry actually likes prison life because he has come from a very difficult family and been in and out of a series of foster homes. In prison, he has three meals a day and he has discovered a talent for drawing. So he is upset that he will have to leave on parole soon. Sad to see his cellmate looking depressed, Barry hatches a plan to get Colin out of jail for the birth. It's a plan so crazy that either it will fail and get both men in deeper trouble, or it might just work.

Saint Odd,['Dean Koontz'],Bantam,2015-01-13,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SUSPENSE MAGAZINE • Includes Dean Koontz’s short story “You Are Destined to Be Together Forever” From “one of the master storytellers of this or any age” (The Tampa Tribune) comes the stunning final adventure of “one of the most remarkable and appealing characters in current fiction”(The Virginian-Pilot)—as Dean Koontz brings the unforgettable odyssey of Odd Thomas to its dazzling conclusion. Odd Thomas is back where it all started . . . because the time has come to finish it. Since he left his simple life in the small town of Pico Mundo, California, his journey has taken him to places strange and wonderful, mysterious and terrifying. Across the land, in the company of mortals and spirits alike, he has known kindness and cruelty, felt love and loss, saved lives and taken them—as he’s borne witness to humanity’s greatest good and darkest evil. Again and again, he has gone where he must and done what he had to do—for better or worse—with his courage and devotion sorely tested, and his soul forever changed. Every triumph has been hard won. Each sacrifice has taken its toll. Now, whatever destiny drives him has finally steered his steps home, where those he cares for most surround him, the memory of his tragically lost true love haunts him, and one last challenge—vast and dreadful—awaits him. For Odd Thomas, born to serve a purpose far greater than himself, the wandering is done. Only the reckoning remains. Praise for Saint Odd “Equal parts supernatural thriller, cultural satire, character study, bildungsroman, offbeat love story, road trip, spiritual meditation, and apocalyptic adventure, the Odd Thomas books . . . are more than irresistible page-turners.

Odd evokes the homespun wisdom of Forrest Gump amid the mind-spinning adventures of a Jack Bauer.”—BookPage “There’s never anything predictable about an Odd Thomas adventure.”—Booklist “The nice young fry cook with the occult powers is [Koontz’s] most likable creation . . . candid, upright, amusing and sometimes withering.”—The New York Times “An inventive . . . mix of suspense, whimsy and uplift.”—The Washington Post “Heartfelt and provocative . . . a wonderfully rich and entertaining story.”—Chicago Sun-Times","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345545886'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345545885'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",352.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.4.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HB1mAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HB1mAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=HB1mAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SAINT+ODD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HB1mAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HB1mAwAAQBAJ,5.0,2.0,An Odd Thomas Novel,,

Endangered Animals,"['Brian Miller', 'Richard P. Reading']",Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2000-09-30,"Explore the multiple issues that surround species declines and conservation efforts through the only reference source to examine the conflicting conservation issues of 49 endangered species. While the causes of endangerment are relatively easy to understand, the ultimate or underlying factors are often far more complex and difficult to address. An introduction to these issues and how to resolve them is provided in this unique collection of case studies of animal species that have been pushed to the brink of extinction. Each case study provides the following information: - Common name - Scientific name - Order - Family - Status - Threats - Habitat - Distribution - Natural history - Conflicting Issues - Future and Prognosis. Conservationists are increasingly recognizing that the ultimate causes of extinction are primarily socio-economic and political, yet biological approaches to recovery continue to dominate. More inclusive, interdisciplinary conservation programs are explored here to offer better prospects for managing problems and conflicts. In addition to the case studies, trends and common themes are explored to provide a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to conservation. Students and teachers can explore a wide variety of endangered species programs and the conflicting issues common to recovery efforts, which will enable them to evaluate conservation practice and to draw their own conclusions for improvement.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780313007231'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0313007233'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",402.0,BOOK,['Science'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJrvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJrvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=QJrvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ENDANGERED&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QJrvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QJrvEAAAQBAJ,,,A Reference Guide to Conflicting Issues,,

Gathering Prey,['John Sandford'],Simon and Schuster,2015-10-22,"The extraordinary new Lucas Davenport thriller from the number one New York Times-bestselling author and Pulitzer Prize-winner John Sandford. They call them Travelers. They move from city to city, panhandling, committing no crimes-they just like to stay on the move. And now somebody is killing them. Lucas Davenport's adopted daughter, Letty, is home from college when she gets a phone call from a woman Traveler she'd befriended in San Francisco. The woman thinks somebody's killing her friends, she's afraid she knows who it is, and now her male companion has gone missing. She's hiding out in North Dakota, and she doesn't know what to do. Letty tells Lucas she's going to get her, and, though he suspects Letty's getting played, he volunteers to go with her. When he hears the woman's story, though, he begins to think there's something in it. Little does he know. In the days to come, he will embark upon an odyssey through a subculture unlike any he has ever seen, a trip that will not only put the two of them in danger-but just may change the course of his life.

RADIANT ANGEL After a showdown with the notorious Yemeni terrorist known as The Panther, John Corey has left the Anti-Terrorist Task Force and returned home to New York City, taking a job with the Diplomatic Surveillance Group. Although Corey's new assignment with the DSG-surveilling Russian diplomats working at the U.N. Mission-is thought to be ""a quiet end,"" he is more than happy to be out from under the thumb of the FBI and free from the bureaucracy of office life. But Corey realizes something the U.S. government doesn't: The all-too-real threat of a newly resurgent Russia. When Vasily Petrov, a colonel in the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service posing as a diplomat with the Russian U.N.

Go Set a Watchman,['Harper Lee'],Random House,2015-07-14,"_________________ A landmark new novel from Harper Lee, set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch – ‘Scout’ – returns home from New York City to visit her ageing father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past – a journey that can be guided only by one’s own conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humour and effortless precision – a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to a classic.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781473535404'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1473535409'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",288.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.5.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vrd7BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vrd7BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vrd7BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:GO+SET+A+WATCHMAN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vrd7BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vrd7BgAAQBAJ,3.0,3.0,Harper Lee's sensational lost novel,,

The Nature of the Beast,['David J. Anderson'],Hachette UK,2022-03-15,"A pioneering neuroscientist offers a new way of understanding how emotions drive behavior Does your dog get sad when you leave for the day? Does your cat purr because she loves you? Do bears attack when they’re angry? You can’t very well ask them. In fact, scientists haven’t been able to reach a consensus on whether animals even have emotions like humans do, let alone how to study them. Yet studies of animal emotion are critical for understanding human emotion and mental illness. In The Nature of the Beast, pioneering neuroscientist David J. Anderson describes a new approach to solving this problem. He and his colleagues have figured out how to study the brain activity of animals as they navigate real-life scenarios, like fleeing a predator or competing for a mate. His research has revolutionized what we know about animal fear and aggression. Here, he explains what studying emotions and related internal brain states in animals can teach us about human behavior, offering new insights into why isolation makes us more aggressive, how sex and violence connect, and whether there’s a link between aggression and mental illness. Full of fascinating stories, The Nature of the Beast reconceptualizes how the brain regulates emotions–and explains why we have them at all.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781541674646'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1541674642'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",271.0,BOOK,['Psychology'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.4.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B2gzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B2gzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=B2gzEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT2&dq=intitle:THE+NATURE+OF+THE+BEAST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B2gzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B2gzEAAAQBAJ,,,How Emotions Guide Us,,

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,['George R. R. Martin'],Bantam,2015-10-06,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Taking place nearly a century before the events of A Game of Thrones, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms compiles the first three official prequel novellas to George R. R. Martin’s ongoing masterwork, A Song of Ice and Fire. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY LOS ANGELES TIMES AND BUZZFEED These never-before-collected adventures recount an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living consciousness. Before Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne, there was Dunk and Egg. A young, naïve but ultimately courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers above his rivals—in stature if not experience. Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg—whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits. Featuring more than 160 all-new illustrations by Gary Gianni, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a must-have collection that proves chivalry isn’t dead—yet. Praise for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms “Readers who already love Martin and his ability to bring visceral human drama out of any story will be thrilled to find this trilogy brought together and injected with extra life.”—Booklist “The real reason to check out this collection is that it’s simply great storytelling. Martin crafts a living, breathing world in a way few authors can. . . . [Gianni’s illustrations] really bring the events of the novellas to life in beautiful fashion.”—Tech Times “Stirring . . . As Tolkien has his Silmarillion, so [George R. R.] Martin has this trilogy of foundational tales. They succeed on their own, but in addition, they succeed in making fans want more.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “Pure fantasy adventure, with two of the most likable protagonists George R. R. Martin has ever penned.”—Bustle “A must-read for Martin’s legion of fans . . . a rousing prelude to [his] bestselling Song of Ice and Fire saga . . . rich in human drama and the colorful worldbuilding that distinguishes other books in the series.”—Publishers Weekly","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345539113'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345539117'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",369.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.7.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o28lBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o28lBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=o28lBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:A+KNIGHT+OF+THE+SEVEN+KINGDOMS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o28lBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o28lBgAAQBAJ,5.0,3.0,,,

On the right side of the law—sort of—Sebastian Rudd is not your typical street lawyer. His office is a customized bulletproof van, complete with Wi-Fi, a bar, a small fridge, and fine leather chairs.

Sebastian drinks small-batch bourbon and carries a gun. He defends people other lawyers won’t go near: a drug-addled, tattooed kid rumored to be in a satanic cult; a vicious crime lord on death row; a homeowner arrested for shooting at a SWAT team that mistakenly invaded his house. Why these clients? Because Sebastian believes everyone is entitled to a fair trial—even if he has to bend the law to secure one.

Tricky Twenty-Two,['Janet Evanovich'],Bantam,2015-11-17,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Something big is brewing in Trenton, N.J., and it could blow at any minute. Stephanie Plum might not be the world’s greatest bounty hunter, but she knows when she’s being played. Ken Globovic (aka Gobbles), hailed as the Supreme Exalted Zookeeper of the animal house known as Zeta fraternity, has been arrested for beating up the dean of students at Kiltman College. Gobbles has missed his court date and gone into hiding. People have seen him on campus, but no one will talk. Things just aren’t adding up, and Stephanie can’t shake the feeling that something funny is going on at the college—and it’s not just Zeta fraternity pranks. As much as people love Gobbles, they hate Doug Linken. When Linken is gunned down in his backyard it’s good riddance, and the list of possible murder suspects is long. The only people who care about finding Linken’s killer are Trenton cop Joe Morelli, who has been assigned the case, security expert Ranger, who was hired to protect Linken, and Stephanie, who has her eye on a cash prize and hopefully has some tricks up her sleeve.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345542984'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345542983'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",304.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.16.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA213&dq=intitle:TRICKY+TWENTY-TWO&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ,,,A Stephanie Plum Novel,,

Justice on the Cross,['Kathleen Christison'],Wipf and Stock Publishers,2023-03-09,"At its heart, liberation theology is a modern theology of resistance to the oppression imposed by colonialist and post-colonialist systems and even by churches that cooperate with secular centers of power to oppress the poor and disadvantaged. It is a grassroots social justice theology, a cri de cœur, that seeks to give spiritual succor and hope to those living in seemingly hopeless circumstances. Palestinians--a people whose suffering has largely been forgotten by the world since Israel's establishment and who are most often stereotyped as extremists and enemies of Israel with no legitimate claim to their own homeland--are among the world's most marginalized populations. The small Palestinian Christian community, an indigenous population descended from Jesus's first followers, has created a liberation theology for the Palestinian context that reaches out to its own Christian faithful and their Muslim compatriots. This is a nonviolent political-theological resistance that follows Jesus's teaching that God is present with all God's children and heeds Jesus's gospel injunctions to comfort the suffering and ""let the oppressed go free."" For Palestinians, their very survival in the land is resistance to Israel's efforts to remove them, and liberation theology sustains their resistance. Jesus was the first liberation theologian.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781666752908'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1666752908'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",214.0,BOOK,['Religion'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iy2zEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iy2zEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iy2zEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=intitle:CROSS+JUSTICE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iy2zEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iy2zEAAAQBAJ,,,"Palestinian Liberation Theology, the Struggle against Israeli Oppression, and the Church",,

My Name Is Lucy Barton,['Elizabeth Strout'],Random House,2016-01-12,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A simple hospital visit becomes a portal to the tender relationship between mother and daughter in this extraordinary novel by the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Olive Kitteridge and The Burgess Boys. Soon to be a Broadway play starring Laura Linney produced by Manhattan Theatre Club and London Theatre Company • LONGLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post • The New York Times Book Review • NPR • BookPage • LibraryReads • Minneapolis Star Tribune • St. Louis Post-Dispatch Lucy Barton is recovering slowly from what should have been a simple operation. Her mother, to whom she hasn’t spoken for many years, comes to see her. Gentle gossip about people from Lucy’s childhood in Amgash, Illinois, seems to reconnect them, but just below the surface lie the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of Lucy’s life: her escape from her troubled family, her desire to become a writer, her marriage, her love for her two daughters. Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable. Praise for My Name Is Lucy Barton “A quiet, sublimely merciful contemporary novel about love, yearning, and resilience in a family damaged beyond words.”—The Boston Globe “It is Lucy’s gentle honesty, complex relationship with her husband, and nuanced response to her mother’s shortcomings that make this novel so subtly powerful.”—San Francisco Chronicle “A short novel about love, particularly the complicated love between mothers and daughters, but also simpler, more sudden bonds . . . It evokes these connections in a style so spare, so pure and so profound the book almost seems to be a kind of scripture or sutra, if a very down-to-earth and unpretentious one.”—Newsday “Spectacular . . . Smart and cagey in every way. It is both a book of withholdings and a book of great openness and wisdom. . . .

Blue,['Michel Pastoureau'],Princeton University Press,2023-07-18,"A beautifully illustrated visual and cultural history of the color blue throughout the ages Blue has had a long and topsy-turvy history in the Western world. The ancient Greeks scorned it as ugly and barbaric, but most Americans and Europeans now cite it as their favorite color. In this fascinating history, the renowned medievalist Michel Pastoureau traces the changing meanings of blue from its rare appearance in prehistoric art to its international ubiquity today. Any history of color is, above all, a social history. Pastoureau investigates how the ever-changing role of blue in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained glass, heraldry, clothing, paintings, and popular culture. Beginning with the almost total absence of blue from ancient Western art and language, the story moves to medieval Europe. As people began to associate blue with the Virgin Mary, the color became a powerful element in church decoration and symbolism. Blue gained new favor as a royal color in the twelfth century and became a formidable political and military force during the French Revolution. As blue triumphed in the modern era, new shades were created and blue became the color of romance and the blues. Finally, Pastoureau follows blue into contemporary times, when military clothing gave way to the everyday uniform of blue jeans and blue became the universal and unifying color of the Earth as seen from space. Beautifully illustrated, Blue tells the intriguing story of our favorite color and the cultures that have hated it, loved it, and made it essential to some of our greatest works of art.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780691251356'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0691251355'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",332.0,BOOK,['Art'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KX3LEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KX3LEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KX3LEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BLUE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KX3LEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KX3LEAAAQBAJ,,,The History of a Color,,

Along the way he runs into backpackers and businessmen, radical hermits and right-wing survivalists - and plenty of ordinary working-parent families too. Sincere but irreverent, this is Nick's guide to avoiding pitfalls, to finding solutions (and some brilliant gadgets) as he strives to perfect the skills of this practical, freewheeling kind of self-sufficiency.

Fool Me Once,['Ashley Winstead'],Harlequin,2022-04-05,"“A simmering slow burn bursting with banter… This is a romance for anyone who’s ever felt too messy to be loved.” —ROSIE DANAN, author of The Roommate In this fierce and funny battle of the exes, Ashley Winstead's Fool Me Once explores the chaos of wanting something you used to have. Lee Stone is a twenty-first-century woman: she kicks butt at her job as a communications director at a women-run electric car company (that’s better than Tesla, thank you), and after work she is “Stoner,” drinking guys under the table and never letting any of them get too comfortable in her bed… That’s because Lee’s learned one big lesson: never trust love. Four major heartbreaks set her straight, from her father cheating on her mom all the way to Ben Laderman in grad school—who wasn’t actually cheating, but she could have sworn he was, so she reciprocated in kind. Then Ben shows up five years later, working as a policy expert for the most liberal governor in Texas history, just as Lee is trying to get a clean energy bill rolling. Things get complicated—and competitive—as Lee and Ben are forced to work together. Tension builds just as old sparks reignite, fanning the flames for a romantic dustup the size of Texas.

Why is economics meaningless without history and without an understanding of institutional and technical change? Does the 'new economy' mean the 'end of history'?an we best understand the impact of revolutionary technologies on business organization and the business cycle? These are some of the questions addressed in this authoritative analysis of modern economic growth from the Industrial Revolution to the 'New Economy' of today. Chris Freeman has been one of the foremost researchers on innovation for a long time and his colleague Francisco Louçã is an outstanding historian of economic theory and an analyst of econometric models and methods. Together they chart the history of five technological revolutions: water-powered mechanization, steam-powered mechanization, electrification, motorization, and computerization. They demonstrate the necessity to take account of politics, culture, organizational change, and entrepreneurship, as well as science and technology in the analysis of economic growth.

The Apartment,['Greg Baxter'],Penguin UK,2012-04-05,"The Apartment, the astonishing first novel by Greg Baxter, is a tale of war and peace, friendship and aloneness. A man walks across an old European capital. Heavy snow falls. He has come here from far away, hoping to forget. Instead, he remembers: home, war, lost friends. Complicity. In the company of a new friend and alive to the new experiences of the city, he moves through the snow and his complicated history in search of an apartment. The Apartment, by the author of the acclaimed memoir A Preparation for Death, is a novel about war, the relationship between America and the rest of the world, and the brittle foundations of Western culture; but above all it is a book about the mysteries and alchemies of friendship - truthful, moving and brilliant. Acclaimed by Hisham Matar, Adam Thorpe and Roddy Doyle, among others, The Apartment is a deeply original and profoundly involving novel. 'Admirable for its scope, ambition and unashamed seriousness of purpose, as well as its willingness to take stylistic and structural risks' Julie Myerson, Observer 'Stunningly good' Susan Jeffreys, Saturday Review, BBC Radio Four 'Baxter's superbly elegant, understated writing explores the dynamics of America's relationship with the rest of the world' The Times 'Lucidly written and astutely observed ...

And it is precisely this sort of subversion, along with the author's shimmering prose, that makes The Apartment such a surprisingly compelling read' New York Times 'Absorbing, atmospheric and enigmatic ... Its long, frigid journey into a long, sleepless night explores a man's uneasy relationship with his past, himself and a world in which violence is inescapable' Los Angeles Times 'Powerful ...

The City of Mirrors,['Justin Cronin'],Ballantine Books,2016-05-24,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A thrilling finale to a trilogy that will stand as one of the great achievements in American fantasy fiction.”—Stephen King You followed The Passage. You faced The Twelve. Now enter The City of Mirrors for the final reckoning. As the bestselling epic races to its breathtaking finale, Justin Cronin’s band of hardened survivors await the second coming of unspeakable darkness. The world we knew is gone. What world will rise in its place? The Twelve have been destroyed and the terrifying hundred-year reign of darkness that descended upon the world has ended. The survivors are stepping outside their walls, determined to build society anew—and daring to dream of a hopeful future. But far from them, in a dead metropolis, he waits: Zero. The First. Father of the Twelve. The anguish that shattered his human life haunts him, and the hatred spawned by his transformation burns bright. His fury will be quenched only when he destroys Amy—humanity’s only hope, the Girl from Nowhere who grew up to rise against him. One last time light and dark will clash, and at last Amy and her friends will know their fate. Look for the entire Passage trilogy: THE PASSAGE | THE TWELVE | THE CITY OF MIRRORS Praise for The City of Mirrors “Compulsively readable.”—The New York Times Book Review “The City of Mirrors is poetry. Thrilling in every way it has to be, but poetry just the same . . .

Sixteen minutes later, the unthinkable happens: the plane plunges into the ocean. The only survivors are the painter Scott Burroughs and a four-year-old boy, who is now the last remaining member of an immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family.

Thirteen-year-old Bina has a long summer ahead of her. She and her best friend, Austin, usually do everything together, but he's off to soccer camp for a month, and he's been acting kind of weird lately anyway. So it's up to Bina to see how much fun she can have on her own. At first it's a lot of guitar playing, boredom, and bad TV, but things look up when she finds an unlikely companion in Austin's older sister, who enjoys music just as much as Bina. But then Austin comes home from camp, and he's acting even weirder than when he left. How Bina and Austin rise above their growing pains and reestablish their friendship and respect for their differences makes for a touching and funny coming-of-age story.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466898189'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466898186'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",176.0,BOOK,['Juvenile Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5hUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T5hUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=T5hUDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ALL+SUMMER+LONG&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T5hUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T5hUDwAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,,,

Foreign Agent,['Brad Thor'],Simon and Schuster,2021-10-05,"In a safe house near the Syrian border, a clandestine American operations team readies to launch a dramatic mission months in the making. Their target: the director of social media for ISIS, Abu Muslim al-Naser. Multiple analysts, as well as a senior congresswoman, are in country to monitor the raid, but before the team can launch, the safe house is attacked. What unfolds in the bloody aftermath is a political and public relations nightmare. As horrific videos of the Americans are published on the Internet, the blame-storming back in Washington goes into full swing, focusing on how the intel for the raid was developed and how it might have leaked. As the search for answers mounts, half spy, half covert counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath quickly finds himself at the center of the storm. Working for a private intelligence agency contracted by both the CIA and the DoD, it was Harvath who pinpointed al-Naser. But how could ISIS have known the Americans were coming, much less where they would be staging? There has to be more to it; something everyone - especially the politicians - is missing.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982148485'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982148489'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DZxBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DZxBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DZxBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FOREIGN+AGENT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=DZxBEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:FOREIGN+AGENT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Foreign_Agent.html?hl=&id=DZxBEAAAQBAJ,,,A Thriller,,

A Curious Mind,"['Brian Grazer', 'Charles Fishman']",Simon and Schuster,2015-04-07,"#1 New York Times bestselling author and Oscar–winning producer Brian Grazer has written a brilliantly entertaining and eye-opening exploration of curiosity and the life-changing effects it can have on every person’s life. From Academy Award–winning producer Brian Grazer, New York Times bestseller A Curious Mind offers a brilliant peek into the “curiosity conversations” that inspired him to create some of the world’s most iconic movies and television shows. He shows how curiosity has been the “secret” that fueled his rise as one of Hollywood’s leading producers and creative visionaries, and how all of us can channel its power to lead bigger and more rewarding lives. Grazer has spent most of his life exploring curiosity through what he terms “curiosity conversations” with some of the most interesting people in the world, including spies, royals, scientists, politicians, moguls, Nobel laureates, artists…anyone whose story might broaden his worldview. These discussions sparked the creative inspiration behind many of his movies and TV shows, including Splash, 24, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, Arrested Development, 8 Mile, J. Edgar, Empire, and many others. A Curious Mind is not only a fascinating page-turner—it also offers a blueprint for how we can awaken our own curiosity and use it as a superpower in our lives. Whether you’re looking to strengthen your management style at work, uncover a new source of creativity, or become a better romantic partner, this book—and its lessons on the power of curiosity—can change your life.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476730790'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476730792'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",320.0,BOOK,['Business & Economics'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.7.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5kAxBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5kAxBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=5kAxBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CURIOUS+MINDS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5kAxBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5kAxBAAAQBAJ,,,The Secret to a Bigger Life,,

Small Great Things,['Jodi Picoult'],Ballantine Books,2016-10-11,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • With richly layered characters and a gripping moral dilemma that will lead readers to question everything they know about privilege, power, and race, Small Great Things is the stunning new page-turner from Jodi Picoult. SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE “[Picoult] offers a thought-provoking examination of racism in America today, both overt and subtle. Her many readers will find much to discuss in the pages of this topical, moving book.”—Booklist (starred review) Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years’ experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she’s been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don’t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy’s counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other’s trust, and come to see that what they’ve been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong. With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn’t offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game. Praise for Small Great Things “Small Great Things is the most important novel Jodi Picoult has ever written. . . . It will challenge her readers . . . [and] expand our cultural conversation about race and prejudice.”—The Washington Post “A novel that puts its finger on the very pulse of the nation that we live in today . . . a fantastic read from beginning to end, as can always be expected from Picoult, this novel maintains a steady, page-turning pace that makes it hard for readers to put down.”—San Francisco Book Review","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345544964'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '034554496X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",528.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.14.14.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:SMALL+GREAT+THINGS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eT5mCwAAQBAJ,3.0,2.0,A Novel,,

Together with friend and colleague Scott Coleman, Rapp struggles to prevent the loss of these lethal weapons, particularly because Russia is also interested in the nukes, though not for the same reason as Rapp and Coleman. Soon, it becomes alarmingly clear that the forces in Moscow are bent on fomenting even more chaos and turmoil in the Middle East, and Rapp must go deep into Russian territory, posing as an American ISIS recruit. There, he uncovers a plan much more dangerous and insidious than he ever expected, one that could have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences. Another “best of the best in the high-adventure, action-heavy thriller field” (Booklist, starred review), Order to Kill is a provocative and timely roller-coaster ride of a novel.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476783505'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476783500'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",368.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.41.32.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3x-zCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3x-zCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3x-zCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:VINCE+FLYNN:+ORDER+TO+KILL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3x-zCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3x-zCwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Tras los muros de Cimmeria (Night School 1),['C.J. Daugherty'],ALFAGUARA INFANTILES Y JUVENILES,2012-03-28,"Cuando todos mienten, ¿en quién puedes confiar? Un mundo de misterio, un mundo de secretos, un mundo de peligros. El mundo de Allie se viene abajo: odia su ciudad, su hermano se ha escapado de casa y ella ha sido arrestada. Otra vez. Sus padres deciden mandarla a una escuela para chicos problemáticos. Pero Cimmeria no es una escuela normal: no permiten ordenadores ni teléfonos móviles y los alumnos son, o superdotados, o ricos. Pero, además, Cimmeria esconde un secreto, un secreto que solo comparten algunos profesores y los alumnos de las misteriosas clases nocturnas de la Night School. A pesar de todo, Allie parece feliz. Ha hecho nuevos amigos y uno de los chicos más atractivos de la escuela le dedica toda su atención. Y, claro, también está su relación con Carter, ese chico solitario con el que siente una inmediata conexión. Todo parece ir bien hasta el momento en que Cimmeria se convierte en un lugar terriblemente peligroso donde nadie parece a salvo.Allie tendrá que elegir en quién confiar mientras descubre los secretos de la escuela. Comentarios: «Lo que más me ha gustado de este libro es lo impredecible que es... Hasta la última parte no se aclaraba del todo el misterio e incluso entonces no estaba segura de si lo que estaba ocurriendo era real. Night School ha sido eso justo algo así, que te mantiene todos tus sentidos en alerta pero no sabes hasta el final qué es lo que está pasando. ¡Night School es un emocionante comienzo de una saga que estoy ansiosa por descubrir!» ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES «Night School es adictivo. Muy adictivo. Me lo he leído muy rápido y al terminarlo me quedé con ganas de más. 451 páginas no han sido suficientes para mí. Por encima de todo, Night School ha sido para mí una lectura apasionante y cautivadora, con grandes personajes y una historia que te mantiene enganchado durante horas. ¡Muy recomendable!» PLANET PRINT «En la Academia Cimmeria hay misterio, asesinatos, algo de mutilación ¡y chicos, chicos, chicos! Y por supuesto una chica malvada... Nada es lo que parece... Night School comienza un poco lento pero pronto despega y no puedes parar de leer con las ganas de saber qué les pasará a los protagonistas de la Academia Cimmeria. Estoy desesperada por poder leer el segundo libro porque el final está lleno de misterio. Creo que la fiesta solo acaba de empezar...» NOVELS ON THE RUN Los blogs han dicho: «Podemos definir Night School como una novela increíble. Entre sus páginas se esconden amor, celos, mentiras, venganza, amistad y misterio. ¿Qué más pedir? Sin duda Night School es una gran apuesta, con una gran historia, que no puedes dejar pasar.» Página tras página «Sin prisa pero sin pausa, Daugherty hace su debut en la novela juvenil con una serie que promete cosas interesantes. A buen ritmo, la autora nos adentra en los muros de Cimmeria, sus normas y sus clases durante buena parte de la historia. Tampoco escatima en detalles con sus personajes. Los alumnos de Cimmeria no caen en tópicos pues cuando menos lo esperes darán un giro inesperado y dejarán a la protagonista dudando hasta de su sombra.

Stephanie Plum has a lot on her plate as she goes undercover in an ice-cream factory in Turbo Twenty-Three, the laugh-out-loud adventure by No. 1 bestselling author Janet Evanovich. The Stephanie Plum series is perfect for fans of Sue Grafton and Lee Child. Raves for the Stephanie Plum series: 'Plum is not just a smart private eye but a heroine with a sense of humour' (Daily Mail); 'Utterly delightful' (Cosmopolitan); 'As smart and sassy as high-gloss wet paint' (Time Out).

The request seems odd, even intrusive—and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating. EMMA Reeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live. But none of the apartments she sees are affordable or feel safe. Until One Folgate Street. The house is an architectural masterpiece: a minimalist design of pale stone, plate glass, and soaring ceilings. But there are rules. The enigmatic architect who designed the house retains full control: no books, no throw pillows, no photos or clutter or personal effects of any kind. The space is intended to transform its occupant—and it does. JANE After a personal tragedy, Jane needs a fresh start. When she finds One Folgate Street she is instantly drawn to the space—and to its aloof but seductive creator. Moving in, Jane soon learns about the untimely death of the home’s previous tenant, a woman similar to Jane in age and appearance. As Jane tries to untangle truth from lies, she unwittingly follows the same patterns, makes the same choices, crosses paths with the same people, and experiences the same terror, as the girl before.

Norse Mythology,['Neil Gaiman'],W. W. Norton & Company,2017-02-07,"“Remarkable.… Gaiman has provided an enchanting contemporary interpretation of the Viking ethos.”—Lisa L. Hannett, Atlantic Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok. In Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki—son of a giant—blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. Gaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780393609103'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0393609103'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",256.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.16.13.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NORSE+MYTHOLOGY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ft2NDAAAQBAJ,4.5,5.0,,,

Robb is the perfect entry point into the compelling In Death police procedural series featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas. As NY Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband Roarke are driving home, a young woman—dazed, naked, and bloody—suddenly stumbles out in front of their car. Roarke slams on the brakes and Eve springs into action. Daphne Strazza is rushed to the ER, but it’s too late for her husband Dr. Anthony Strazza. A brilliant orthopedic surgeon, he now lies dead amid the wreckage of his obsessively organized town house, his three safes opened and emptied. Daphne would be a valuable witness, but in her terror and shock the only description of the perp she can offer is repeatedly calling him “the devil”... While it emerges that Dr. Strazza was cold, controlling, and widely disliked, this is one case where the evidence doesn’t point to the spouse. So Eve and her team must get started on the legwork, interviewing everyone from dinner-party guests to professional colleagues to caterers, in a desperate race to answer some crucial questions: What does the devil look like?

Lincoln in the Bardo,['George Saunders'],Random House,2017-02-14,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE The “devastatingly moving” (People) first novel from the author of Tenth of December: a moving and original father-son story featuring none other than Abraham Lincoln, as well as an unforgettable cast of supporting characters, living and dead, historical and invented Named One of Paste’s Best Novels of the Decade • Named One of the Ten Best Books of the Year by The Washington Post, USA Today, and Maureen Corrigan, NPR • One of Time’s Ten Best Novels of the Year • A New York Times Notable Book • One of O: The Oprah Magazine’s Best Books of the Year February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy’s body. From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state—called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo—a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie’s soul. Lincoln in the Bardo is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction’s ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end? “A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.”—Colson Whitehead, The New York Times Book Review “A masterpiece.”—Zadie Smith","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812995350'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '081299535X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",369.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.14.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ofQqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ofQqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ofQqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:LINCOLN+IN+THE+BARDO&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ofQqDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ofQqDAAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,
Empire's End: Aftermath (Star Wars),['Chuck Wendig'],Del Rey,2017-02-21,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Following Star Wars: Aftermath and Star Wars: Life Debt, Chuck Wendig delivers the exhilarating conclusion to the New York Times bestselling trilogy set in the years between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens. EVERY END IS A NEW BEGINNING. As the final showdown between the New Republic and the Empire draws near, all eyes turn to a once-isolated planet: Jakku. The Battle of Endor shattered the Empire, scattering its remaining forces across the galaxy. But the months following the Rebellion’s victory have not been easy. The fledgling New Republic has suffered a devastating attack from the Imperial remnant, forcing the new democracy to escalate its hunt for the hidden enemy. For her role in the deadly ambush, Grand Admiral Rae Sloane is the most wanted Imperial war criminal—and one-time rebel pilot Norra Wexley, back in service at Leia’s urgent request, is leading the hunt. But more than just loyalty to the New Republic drives Norra forward: Her husband was turned into a murderous pawn in Sloane’s assassination plot, and now she wants vengeance as much as justice. Sloane, too, is on a furious quest: pursuing the treacherous Gallius Rax to the barren planet Jakku. As the true mastermind behind the Empire’s devastating attack, Rax has led the Empire to its defining moment. The cunning strategist has gathered the powerful remnants of the Empire’s war machine, preparing to execute the late Emperor Palpatine’s final plan. As the Imperial fleet orbits Jakku, an armada of Republic fighters closes in to finish what began at Endor. Norra and her crew soar into the heart of an apocalyptic clash that will leave land and sky alike scorched. And the future of the galaxy will finally be decided.

Dangerous Games,['Margaret MacMillan'],National Geographic Books,2010-07-13,"Acclaimed historian Margaret MacMillan explores here the many ways in which history affects us all. She shows how a deeper engagement with history, both as individuals and in the sphere of public debate, can help us understand ourselves and the world better. But she also warns that history can be misused and lead to misunderstanding. History is used to justify religious movements and political campaigns alike. Dictators may suppress history because it undermines their ideas, agendas, or claims to absolute authority. Nationalists may tell false, one-sided, or misleading stories about the past. Political leaders might mobilize their people by telling lies. It is imperative that we have an understanding of the past and avoid these and other common traps in thinking to which many fall prey. This brilliantly reasoned work, alive with incident and figures both great and infamous, will compel us to examine history anew—and skillfully illuminates why it is important to treat the past with care.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780812979961'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0812979966'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",0.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BSiPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BSiPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BSiPEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:DANGEROUS+GAMES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=BSiPEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:DANGEROUS+GAMES&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Dangerous_Games.html?hl=&id=BSiPEAAAQBAJ,,,The Uses and Abuses of History,,

If Not for You,['Debbie Macomber'],Ballantine Books,2017-03-21,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Debbie Macomber has written an emotionally stirring novel that shows how sometimes a choice can seem wrong even though it’s absolutely right. If not for her loving but controlling parents, Beth Prudhomme might never have taken charge of her life and moved from her native Chicago to Portland, Oregon, where she’s reconnected with her spirited Aunt Sunshine and found a job as a high school music teacher. If not for her friend Nichole, Beth would never have met Sam Carney, although first impressions have left Beth with serious doubts. Sam is everything Beth is not—and her parents’ worst nightmare: a tattooed auto mechanic who’s rough around the edges. Reserved and smart as a whip, Beth isn’t exactly Sam’s usual beer-drinking, pool-playing type of woman, either. But if not for an awkward setup one evening, Beth might never have left early and been involved in a car crash. And if not for Sam—who witnessed the terrifying ordeal, rushed to her aid, and stayed with her until help arrived—Beth might have been all alone, or worse. Yet as events play out, Sam feels compelled to check on Beth almost daily at the hospital—even bringing his guitar to play songs to lift her spirits. Soon their unlikely friendship evolves into an intense attraction that surprises them both. Before long, Beth’s strong-willed mother, Ellie, blows into town spouting harsh opinions, especially about Sam, and reopening old wounds with Sunshine. When shocking secrets from Sam’s past are revealed, Beth struggles to reconcile her feelings. But when Beth goes a step too far, she risks losing the man and the life she’s come to love.

Thrawn (Star Wars),['Timothy Zahn'],Random House Worlds,2017-04-11,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “The origin story of one of the greatest Star Wars villains . . . a book that fans have wanted for decades.”—The Verge One of the most cunning and ruthless warriors in the history of the Galactic Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn is also one of the most captivating villains in the Star Wars universe. Since his introduction in bestselling author Timothy Zahn’s classic Heir to the Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn has earned an iconic status equal only to the most notorious of Sith lords, Darth Vader. But Thrawn’s origins and the story of his rise in the Imperial ranks have remained mysterious. Now, in Star Wars: Thrawn, Zahn chronicles the fateful events that launched the blue-skinned, red-eyed master of military strategy and lethal warfare into the highest realms of power—and infamy. After Thrawn is rescued from exile by Imperial soldiers, his deadly ingenuity and keen tactical abilities swiftly capture the attention of Emperor Palpatine. And just as quickly, Thrawn proves to be as indispensable to the Empire as he is ambitious; as devoted as its most loyal servant, Darth Vader; and a brilliant warrior never to be underestimated. On missions to rout smugglers, snare spies, and defeat pirates, he triumphs time and again—even as his renegade methods infuriate superiors while inspiring ever greater admiration from the Empire. As one promotion follows another in his rapid ascension to greater power, he schools his trusted aide, Ensign Eli Vanto, in the arts of combat and leadership, and the secrets of claiming victory. But even though Thrawn dominates the battlefield, he has much to learn in the arena of politics where ruthless administrator Arihnda Pryce holds the power to be a potent ally or a brutal enemy. All these lessons will be put to the ultimate test when Thrawn rises to admiral and must pit all the knowledge, instincts, and battle forces at his command against an insurgent uprising that threatens not only innocent lives but also the Empire’s grip on the galaxy—and his own carefully laid plans for future ascendancy.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345542847'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345542843'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",514.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.13.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OuvDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6OuvDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6OuvDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THRAWN&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6OuvDAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THRAWN&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Thrawn_Star_Wars.html?hl=&id=6OuvDAAAQBAJ,5.0,4.0,,,

Golden Prey,['John Sandford'],Penguin,2017-04-25,"THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Lucas Davenport’s first case as a U.S. Marshal sends him into uncharted territory in the thrilling new novel in the #1 New York Times-bestselling series. The man was smart and he didn’t mind killing people. Welcome to the big leagues, Davenport. Thanks to some very influential people whose lives he saved, Lucas is no longer working for the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, but for the U.S. Marshals Service, and with unusual scope. He gets to pick his own cases, whatever they are, wherever they lead him. And where they’ve led him this time is into real trouble. A Biloxi, Mississippi, drug-cartel counting house gets robbed, and suitcases full of cash disappear, leaving behind five bodies, including that of a six-year-old girl. Davenport takes the case, which quickly spirals out of control, as cartel assassins, including a torturer known as the “Queen of home-improvement tools” compete with Davenport to find the Dixie Hicks shooters who knocked over the counting house. Things get ugly real fast, and neither the cartel killers nor the holdup men give a damn about whose lives Davenport might have saved; to them, he’s just another large target. Filled with his trademark razor-sharp plotting and some of the best characters in suspense fiction, Golden Prey is further reason why “Sandford has always been at the top of any list of great mystery writers” (The Huffington Post).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780399184581'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0399184589'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",400.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6s7GDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6s7GDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=6s7GDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:GOLDEN+PREY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6s7GDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6s7GDAAAQBAJ,,,,,

Earlier in the summer, a vulnerable teenage girl met the same fate. They are not the first women lost to these dark waters, but their deaths disturb the river and its history, dredging up secrets long submerged. Left behind is a lonely fifteen-year-old girl. Parentless and friendless, she now finds herself in the care of her mother's sister, a fearful stranger who has been dragged back to the place she deliberately ran from—a place to which she vowed she'd never return. With the same propulsive writing and acute understanding of human instincts that captivated millions of readers around the world in her explosive debut thriller, The Girl on the Train, Paula Hawkins delivers an urgent, twisting, deeply satisfying read that hinges on the deceptiveness of emotion and memory, as well as the devastating ways that the past can reach a long arm into the present.

A Column of Fire,['Ken Follett'],Penguin,2017-09-12,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “Absorbing . . . impossible to resist.” —The Washington Post As Europe erupts, can one young spy protect his queen? #1 New York Times bestselling author Ken Follett takes us deep into the treacherous world of powerful monarchs, intrigue, murder, and treason with his magnificent new epic, A Column of Fire. A thrilling read that makes the perfect gift for the holidays. In 1558, the ancient stones of Kingsbridge Cathedral look down on a city torn apart by religious conflict. As power in England shifts precariously between Catholics and Protestants, royalty and commoners clash, testing friendship, loyalty, and love. Ned Willard wants nothing more than to marry Margery Fitzgerald. But when the lovers find themselves on opposing sides of the religious conflict dividing the country, Ned goes to work for Princess Elizabeth. When she becomes queen, all Europe turns against England. The shrewd, determined young monarch sets up the country’s first secret service to give her early warning of assassination plots, rebellions, and invasion plans. Over a turbulent half century, the love between Ned and Margery seems doomed as extremism sparks violence from Edinburgh to Geneva. Elizabeth clings to her throne and her principles, protected by a small, dedicated group of resourceful spies and courageous secret agents. The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions. The true battle pitches those who believe in tolerance and compromise against the tyrants who would impose their ideas on everyone else—no matter what the cost. Set during one of the most turbulent and revolutionary times in history, A Column of Fire is one of Follett’s most exciting and ambitious works yet. It will delight longtime fans of the Kingsbridge series and is the perfect introduction for readers new to Ken Follett.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780735224476'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0735224471'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",930.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,4.12.11.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jjTBDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jjTBDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jjTBDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA802&dq=intitle:A+COLUMN+OF+FIRE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jjTBDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jjTBDQAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Stay true to who you are,['Vanessa van Cartier'],Kosmos Uitgevers,2022-05-17,"‘Stay true to who you are’ vertelt het bijzondere levensverhaal van Vanessa van Cartier, winnares van Drag Race Holland. Met voorwoord van Fred van Leer. Behalve topartiest is Vanessa van Cartier ook een rolmodel voor iedereen die zichzelf wil (leren) zijn. In Stay true to who you are vertelt zij haar ontroerende verhaal. Het lijkt Vanessa voor de wind te gaan. Ze groeide uit tot een wereldberoemde dragqueen en won vele verkiezingen. Honderdduizenden kijkers zagen hoe Vanessa het tweede seizoen van Drag Race Holland won. Ze is een artiest van wereldformaat, maar haar weg naar de top was lang en pijnlijk. In dit boek deelt ze het hobbelige pad dat ze heeft bewandeld om te zijn wie ze nu is. Ze bracht een groot deel van haar jeugd door in Italië, een tijd die alles behalve rooskleurig was. Ze kreeg te maken met pesten, mishandeling, eenzaamheid en een agressieve, dominante vader. Stapje voor stapje klom ze na die nare jeugd op. Ze kwam in aanraking met drag en leerde dat dit een mooie, maar ook keiharde wereld is. Onderwerpen als haar transitie, discriminatie, depressie en suïcidale gedachten passeren de revue. Maar ook hoe ze de liefde van haar leven vond en hoe ze zich herpakte en omringde met positieve en uitzonderlijke mensen die haar omhoog stuwen. Met haar verhaal wil ze anderen die in een vergelijkbare positie verkeren hoop bieden: blijf altijd geloven in wie je bent! “Vanessa's story and heart and words will move you and teach you what true kindness and courage looks like. I’m so happy to have Vanessa in my life and with this book you can as well” – Sam Smith Het boek bevat ook veel aanvullende informatie over de onderwerpen pesten en seksuele geaardheid, hiv en aids, kindermishandeling, travestie en drag, transgender personen en depressie.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789021590424'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9021590425'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",247.0,BOOK,['Biography & Autobiography'],NOT_MATURE,False,1.4.3.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRJoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRJoEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",nl,http://books.google.nl/books?id=PRJoEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&dq=intitle:TO+BE+WHERE+YOU+ARE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRJoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRJoEAAAQBAJ,,,Het bijzondere levensverhaal van Vanessa van Cartier,,

Deep Freeze,['Dian Olson Belanger'],University Press of Colorado,2019-04-01,"“A comprehensive and lively book about the people and events that transformed Antarctica into an international laboratory for science.”—Raimund E. Goerler, Chief Archivist/Byrd Polar Research Center of The Ohio State University In Deep Freeze, Dian Olson Belanger tells the story of the pioneers who built viable communities, made vital scientific discoveries, and established Antarctica as a continent dedicated to peace and the pursuit of science, decades after the first explorers planted flags in the ice. In the tense 1950s, even as the world was locked in the Cold War, U.S. scientists, maintained by the Navy’s Operation Deep Freeze, came together in Antarctica with counterparts from eleven other countries to participate in the International Geophysical Year (IGY). On July 1, 1957, they began systematic, simultaneous scientific observations of the south-polar ice and atmosphere. Their collaborative success over eighteen months inspired the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which formalized their peaceful pursuit of scientific knowledge. Still building on the achievements of the individuals and distrustful nations thrown together by the IGY from mutually wary military, scientific, and political cultures, science prospers today and peace endures. Belanger draws from interviews, diaries, memoirs, and official records to weave together the first thorough study of the dawn of Antarctica’s scientific age. Deep Freeze offers absorbing reading for those who have ventured onto Antarctic ice and those who dream of it, as well as historians, scientists, and policy makers. “[A] highly informative and readable narrative account of perhaps the single most striking international scientific endeavor of the twentieth century.” —The Polar Record “Deep Freeze, based on countless interviews and painstaking research, is a timely and gripping account.” —John C.

But maybe there's a way out. Maybe there’s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school.

In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance. Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified. Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.

Hardcore Twenty-Four,['Janet Evanovich'],Penguin,2017-11-14,"Janet Evanovich’s #1 New York Times bestselling sensation Stephanie Plum returns in her twenty-forth thriller as mutilated corpses litter the streets of New Jersey... Trouble comes in bunches for Stephanie Plum. First, professional grave robber and semi-professional loon, Simon Diggery, won’t let her take him in until she agrees to care for his boa constrictor, Ethel. Stephanie’s main qualification for babysitting an extremely large snake is that she owns a stun gun—whether that’s for use on the wandering serpent or the petrified neighbors remains to be seen. Events take a dark turn when headless bodies start appearing across town. At first, it’s just corpses from a funeral home and the morgue that have had the heads removed. But when a homeless man is murdered and dumped behind a church Stephanie knows that she’s the only one with a prayer of catching this killer. If all that’s not enough, Diesel’s back in town. The 6-foot-tall, blonde-haired hunk is a man who accepts no limits—that includes locked doors, closed windows and underwear. Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli isn’t pleased at this unexpected arrival nor is Ranger, the high-powered security consultant who has his own plans for Stephanie.

The Woman in the Window,['A. J. Finn'],HarperCollins,2018-01-02,"#1 New York Times Bestseller – Soon to be a Major Motion Picture starring Amy Adams, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman – Available on Netflix on May 14, 2021 “Astounding. Thrilling. Amazing.” —Gillian Flynn “Unputdownable.” —Stephen King “A dark, twisty confection.” —Ruth Ware “Absolutely gripping.” —Louise Penny For readers of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade’s most anticipated debuts, to be published in thirty-six languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: a twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house. It isn’t paranoia if it’s really happening . . . Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors. Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare. What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems. Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062678447'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062678442'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",491.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.26.24.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hxCkDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hxCkDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hxCkDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+WOMAN+IN+THE+WINDOW&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hxCkDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hxCkDgAAQBAJ,4.5,5.0,A Novel,,

Dark in Death,['J. D. Robb'],St. Martin's Press,2018-01-30,"Lieutenant Eve Dallas returns in Dark in Death, by J.D. Robb, the #1 New York Times bestselling master of suspense, and takes on a case of death imitating art... It was a stab in the dark. On a chilly February night, during a screening of Psycho in midtown, someone sunk an ice pick into the back of Chanel Rylan’s neck, then disappeared quietly into the crowds of drunks and tourists in Times Square. To Chanel’s best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanel’s blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional. Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crime—from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesn’t think it’s coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs. But this killer seems to find inspiration in someone else’s imagination, and if the theory holds, this may be only the second of a long-running series. The good news is that Eve and her billionaire husband Roarke have an excuse to curl up in front of the fireplace with their cat, Galahad, reading mystery stories for research. The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murderer’s deranged private drama—and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong. From the author of Echoes in Death, this is the latest of the edgy, phenomenally popular police procedurals that Publishers Weekly calls “inventive, entertaining, and clever.”","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250161550'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '125016155X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",384.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.8.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJomDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJomDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=JJomDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DARK+IN+DEATH&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJomDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJomDwAAQBAJ,,,"An Eve Dallas Novel (In Death, Book 46)",,

Star Wars: The Last Jedi,['Jason Fry'],Luitingh Sijthoff Fantasy,2018-07-16,"Fry, Jason – Star Wars: The Last Jedi webtekst Star Wars: The Last Jedi is het officiële verhaal van de gelijknamige film van Disney, geschreven met input van regisseur Rian Johnson, en uitgebreid met alternatieve versies van het script en nog niet eerder vertoonde scènes. Uit de as van het Keizerrijk is een nieuwe dreiging verrezen die de vrijheid van het hele sterrenstelsel bedreigt: de meedogenloze Eerste Orde. Gelukkig zijn er ook nieuwe helden opgestaan om de wapens op te pakken – en misschien zelfs hun levens op het spel te zetten – voor de goede zaak. Rey, de wees die alsmaar sterker wordt in de Kracht, Finn, de ex-stormtroeper die het opneemt tegen zijn oude meesters, en Poe Dameron, de onverschrokken X-wing piloot, vechten zij aan zij met Generaal Leia Organa en het Verzet. Maar hun tegenstander Snoke, de leider van de Eerste Orde, en zijn genadeloze secondant Kylo Ren hebben een overmacht aan soldaten en vuurkracht. Deze vijand betekent mogelijk het einde van de kampioenen van het licht. Hun enige hoop is nu gevestigd op een verloren legende: Jedi-leraar Luke Skywalker.

Accidental Heroes,['Danielle Steel'],Delacorte Press,2018-03-20,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A decorated former Air Force pilot. A pregnant flight attendant. A dedicated TSA agent. The fates of these three, and many others, converge in Danielle Steel’s gripping new novel—a heart-stopping thriller that engages ordinary men and women in the fight of their lives during a flight from New York to San Francisco. On a beautiful May morning at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport, two planes have just departed for San Francisco—one a 757, another a smaller Airbus A321. At a security checkpoint, TSA agent Bernice Adams finds a postcard of the Golden Gate Bridge bearing an ambiguous—perhaps ominous—message. Her supervisor dismisses her concerns, but Bernice calls security and soon Ben Waterman arrives. A senior Homeland Security agent, still grappling with guilt after a disastrous operation in which hostages were killed, Ben too becomes suspicious. Who left the postcard behind, which flight is that person on, and what exactly does the message mean? As Ben scans the passenger manifests, his focus turns to the A321, with Helen Smith as its senior pilot. Helen’s military service and her tenure with the airline have been exemplary. But her husband’s savage death in Iraq was more than anyone should bear, leaving her widowed with three children. A major film star is on board. So is an off-duty pilot who has just lost his forty-year career. So is a distraught father, traveling with the baby son he has abducted from his estranged wife. Sifting through data and relying on instinct, Ben becomes convinced that someone on Helen’s plane is planning something terrible. And he’s right. Passengers, crew, and experts on the ground become heroes out of necessity to try to avert tragedy at the eleventh hour. In her stunning novel, Danielle Steel combines intense action with stories of emotionally rich, intertwined lives. As the jet bears down on its destination of San Francisco, strangers are united, desperate choices are made, and futures will be changed forever by a handful of accidental heroes.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781101884102'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '110188410X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",272.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z4UpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z4UpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=z4UpDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:ACCIDENTAL+HEROES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4UpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4UpDwAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,A Novel,,

The Female Persuasion,['Meg Wolitzer'],Penguin,2018-04-03,"A New York Times Bestseller “A powerful coming-of-age story that looks at ambition, friendship, identity, desire, and power from the much-needed female lens."" —Bustle “Ultra-readable.” —Vogue From the New York Times-bestselling author of The Interestings, comes an electric novel not just about who we want to be with, but who we want to be. To be admired by someone we admire—we all yearn for this: the private, electrifying pleasure of being singled out by someone of esteem. But sometimes it can also mean entry to a new kind of life, a bigger world. Greer Kadetsky is a shy college freshman when she meets the woman she hopes will change her life. Faith Frank, dazzlingly persuasive and elegant at sixty-three, has been a central pillar of the women’s movement for decades, a figure who inspires others to influence the world. Upon hearing Faith speak for the first time, Greer—madly in love with her boyfriend, Cory, but still full of longing for an ambition that she can’t quite place—feels her inner world light up. And then, astonishingly, Faith invites Greer to make something out of that sense of purpose, leading Greer down the most exciting path of her life as it winds toward and away from her meant-to-be love story with Cory and the future she’d always imagined. Charming and wise, knowing and witty, Meg Wolitzer delivers a novel about power and influence, ego and loyalty, womanhood and ambition. At its heart, The Female Persuasion is about the flame we all believe is flickering inside of us, waiting to be seen and fanned by the right person at the right time. It’s a story about the people who guide and the people who follow (and how those roles evolve over time), and the desire within all of us to be pulled into the light.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525533221'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525533222'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",464.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.2.2.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2qYrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2qYrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2qYrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+FEMALE+PERSUASION&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=2qYrDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+FEMALE+PERSUASION&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Female_Persuasion.html?hl=&id=2qYrDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Experience the internet's most talked-about book from Anna Todd, the writer Cosmopolitan called “the biggest literary phenomenon of her generation”—now with new exclusive material! There was the time before Tessa met Hardin, and then there’s everything AFTER... Life will never be the same. #Hessa Tessa is a good girl with a sweet, reliable boyfriend back home. She’s got direction, ambition, and a mother who’s intent on keeping her that way. But she’s barely moved into her freshman dorm when she runs into Hardin. With his tousled brown hair, cocky British accent, and tattoos, Hardin is cute and different from what she’s used to. But he’s also rude—to the point of cruelty, even. For all his attitude, Tessa should hate Hardin. And she does—until she finds herself alone with him in his room. Something about his dark mood grabs her, and when they kiss it ignites within her a passion she’s never known before. He'll call her beautiful, then insist he isn’t the one for her and disappear again and again. Despite the reckless way he treats her, Tessa is compelled to dig deeper and find the real Hardin beneath all his lies. He pushes her away again and again, yet every time she pushes back, he only pulls her in deeper. Tessa already has the perfect boyfriend.

Twisted Prey,['John Sandford'],Penguin,2018-04-24,"Lucas Davenport confronts an old nemesis, now a powerful U.S. senator, in this thrilling #1 New York Times-bestselling new novel in the Prey series. Lucas Davenport had crossed paths with her before. A rich psychopath, Taryn Grant had run successfully for the U.S. Senate, where Lucas had predicted she'd fit right in. He was also convinced that she'd been responsible for three murders, though he'd never been able to prove it. Once a psychopath had gotten that kind of rush, though, he or she often needed another fix, so he figured he might be seeing her again. He was right. A federal marshal now, with a very wide scope of investigation, he's heard rumors that Grant has found her seat on the Senate intelligence committee, and the contacts she's made from it, to be very...useful. Pinning those rumors down was likely to be just as difficult as before, and considerably more dangerous. But they had unfinished business, he and Grant. One way or the other, he was going to see it through to the end.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780735217362'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '073521736X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",400.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.8.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ccgyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ccgyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=ccgyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TWISTED+PREY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ccgyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ccgyDwAAQBAJ,,,,,
The Hellfire Club,['Daniel P. Mannix'],eNet Press,2015-02-24,"Brilliant, amusing, and utterly immoral, young noblemen, politicians, artists and other eminent men of eighteenth century England thronged to the abbey of Medmenham and the elaborately decorated caves and gardens of West Wycombe Park to attend meetings of a club that outraged and threatened the security of an entire country — the notorious Hellfire Club. Dedicated to black magic, sexual orgies, and political conspiracies, the records of their elaborately obscene rituals, jests, and parties have both fascinated and appalled the world for over three centuries. The Hellfire Club became popular during an age of scandal. Standards of respectability had become middle class — a middle class who knew nothing of art and literature and whose outlook was bound by a set of stereotyped conventions. Respect for the monarchy, religion, or the ideals of decency and morality? Bah humbug. The club's members — ""mad geniuses who. . . could do anything from writing double entendre verses in Greek to ruining an opposing statesman by a clever satirical sketch"" — set out to ridicule and destroy these conventions and at times they almost succeeded. The originator and guiding presence of the Hellfire Club was Sir Francis Dashwood — son of a grim and fiercely ruthless baronet, heir to one of the great fortunes of the time, and George III's intimate friend. Possessing a flair for politics and a proclivity for the profane, it is largely because of his influence that the Hellfire Club was to eventually count among its members the Prime Minister of England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Mayor of London, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, several of England's greatest artists and poets, the Prince of Wales, and Benjamin Franklin. Red robes, screaming girls, unscrupulous madams, firelight on the walls of a cave, and unspeakable acts for the sake of amusement. Daniel P Mannix addresses the reasons for the rise of the Hellfire Club, its singular influence on the course of history, and its inevitable destruction.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781618867452'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1618867458'}]","{'text': False, 'image': True}",161.0,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9JrXBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9JrXBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9JrXBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+HELLFIRE+CLUB&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=9JrXBgAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+HELLFIRE+CLUB&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Hellfire_Club.html?hl=&id=9JrXBgAAQBAJ,,,,,

The High Tide Club,['Mary Kay Andrews'],St. Martin's Press,2018-05-08,"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Weekenders comes a delightful new novel about new love, old secrets, and the kind of friendship that transcends generations. When ninety-nine-year-old heiress Josephine Bettendorf Warrick summons Brooke Trappnell to Talisa Island, her 20,000 acre remote barrier island home, Brooke is puzzled. Everybody in the South has heard about the eccentric millionaire mistress of Talisa, but Brooke has never met her. Josephine’s cryptic note says she wants to discuss an important legal matter with Brooke, who is an attorney, but Brooke knows that Mrs. Warrick has long been a client of a prestigious Atlanta law firm. Over a few meetings, the ailing Josephine spins a tale of old friendships, secrets, betrayal and a long-unsolved murder. She tells Brooke she is hiring her for two reasons: to protect her island and legacy from those who would despoil her land, and secondly, to help her make amends with the heirs of the long dead women who were her closest friends, the girls of The High Tide Club—so named because of their youthful skinny dipping escapades—Millie, Ruth and Varina. When Josephine dies with her secrets intact, Brooke is charged with contacting Josephine’s friends’ descendants and bringing them together on Talisa for a reunion of women who’ve actually never met. The High Tide Club is Mary Kay Andrews at her Queen of the Beach Reads best, a compelling and witty tale of romance thwarted, friendships renewed, justice delivered, and true love found.

Liberal and like-minded, the friends have come to the countryside in the hope of restoring the bubble in which they have grown used to living. Moving through her days accompanied by a carefully curated salon, Eva Lindquist is a generous hostess with an obsession for decorating. Yet when, in her avidity to secure shelter for herself, she persuades her husband to buy a grand if dilapidated apartment in Venice, she unwittingly sets off the chain of events that will propel him to venture outside the bubble and embark on an unexpected love affair.

Seckatary Hawkins and the other boys saw him take that terrible fall into the cliff cave abyss. But the masked marauder known as the Gray Ghost is back -- running the river and causing mischief... or is he? It's not altogether clear whether or not someone from the old Red Runner gang, either Androfski the Silent or Jude the Fifth, is masquerading as the Fair and Square Club's old archenemy to hide from the law. Plus, there's a new boy in town named Simon Bleaker who seems just as rotten and wily as Stoner's Boy ever was. Will Seck and his friends be able to solve the mystery in time and bring peace back to the riverbank? Before Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, Seckatary Hawkins and his friends were solving mysteries and thrilling readers with tales of adventure, loyalty, and courage.

Thrawn: Alliances (Star Wars),['Timothy Zahn'],Random House Worlds,2018-07-24,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Grand Admiral Thrawn and Darth Vader team up against a threat to the Empire in this thrilling novel from bestselling author Timothy Zahn. “I have sensed a disturbance in the Force.” Ominous words under any circumstances, but all the more so when uttered by Emperor Palpatine. On Batuu, at the edge of the Unknown Regions, a threat to the Empire is taking root—its existence little more than a glimmer, its consequences as yet unknowable. But it is troubling enough to the Imperial leader to warrant investigation by his most powerful agents: ruthless enforcer Lord Vader and brilliant strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Fierce rivals for the Emperor’s favor and outspoken adversaries on Imperial affairs—including the Death Star project—the formidable pair seem unlikely partners for such a crucial mission. But the Emperor knows it’s not the first time Vader and Thrawn have joined forces. And there’s more behind his royal command than either man suspects. In what seems like a lifetime ago, General Anakin Skywalker of the Galactic Republic and Commander Mitth’raw’nuruodo, officer of the Chiss Ascendancy, crossed paths for the first time. One on a desperate personal quest, the other with motives unknown . . . and undisclosed. But facing a gauntlet of dangers on a far-flung world, they forged an uneasy alliance—neither remotely aware of what his future held in store. Now, thrust together once more, they find themselves bound again for the planet where they once fought side by side. There they will be doubly challenged—by a test of their allegiance to the Empire . . . and by an enemy that threatens even their combined might. Praise for Thrawn: Alliances “It’s a science fiction beach read in the best way, brisk and amusing, with some cool additions to the Star Wars galaxy.”—Den of Geek “Like all of Zahn’s novels set in a galaxy far, far away, it’s an essential read for anyone looking for an artistically done adventure.”—CNET","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525480730'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525480730'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",419.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.9.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=keA4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=keA4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=keA4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THRAWN:+ALLIANCES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=keA4DwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THRAWN:+ALLIANCES&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Thrawn_Alliances_Star_Wars.html?hl=&id=keA4DwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Time's Convert,['Deborah Harkness'],Penguin,2018-09-18,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Discovery of Witches and The Black Bird Oracle comes a novel about what it takes to become a vampire—the fourth in the All Souls series. Look for the hit series “A Discovery of Witches,” now streaming on AMC+, Sundance Now, and Shudder! On the battlefields of the American Revolution, Matthew de Clermont meets Marcus MacNeil, a young surgeon from Massachusetts, during a moment of political awakening when it seems that the world is on the brink of a brighter future. When Matthew offers him a chance at immortality and a new life free from the restraints of his puritanical upbringing, Marcus seizes the opportunity to become a vampire. But his transformation is not an easy one and the ancient traditions and responsibilities of the de Clermont family clash with Marcus's deeply held beliefs in liberty, equality, and brotherhood. Fast-forward to contemporary Paris, where Phoebe Taylor--the young employee at Sotheby's whom Marcus has fallen for--is about to embark on her own journey to immortality. Though the modernized version of the process at first seems uncomplicated, the couple discovers that the challenges facing a human who wishes to be a vampire are no less formidable than they were in the eighteenth century. The shadows that Marcus believed he'd escaped centuries ago may return to haunt them both--forever. A passionate love story and a fascinating exploration of the power of tradition and the possibilities not just for change but for revolution, Time's Convert, the fourth books in the All Souls Series channels the supernatural world-building and slow-burning romance that made the previous books instant bestsellers to illuminate a new and vital moment in history, and a love affair that will bridge centuries.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780399564529'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0399564527'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",450.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.15.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wl1KDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wl1KDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Wl1KDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:TIME%27S+CONVERT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wl1KDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wl1KDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,
An Absolutely Remarkable Thing,['Hank Green'],Penguin,2018-09-25,"THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “Sparkling with mystery, humor and the uncanny, this is a fun read. But beneath its effervescent tone, more complex themes are at play.” —San Francisco Chronicle In his wildly entertaining debut novel, Hank Green—cocreator of Crash Course, Vlogbrothers, and SciShow—spins a sweeping, cinematic tale about a young woman who becomes an overnight celebrity before realizing she's part of something bigger, and stranger, than anyone could have possibly imagined. The Carls just appeared. Roaming through New York City at three a.m., twenty-three-year-old April May stumbles across a giant sculpture. Delighted by its appearance and craftsmanship—like a ten-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor—April and her best friend, Andy, make a video with it, which Andy uploads to YouTube. The next day, April wakes up to a viral video and a new life. News quickly spreads that there are Carls in dozens of cities around the world—from Beijing to Buenos Aires—and April, as their first documentarian, finds herself at the center of an intense international media spotlight. Seizing the opportunity to make her mark on the world, April now has to deal with the consequences her new particular brand of fame has on her relationships, her safety, and her own identity. And all eyes are on April to figure out not just what the Carls are, but what they want from us. Compulsively entertaining and powerfully relevant, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing grapples with big themes, including how the social internet is changing fame, rhetoric, and radicalization; how our culture deals with fear and uncertainty; and how vilification and adoration spring for the same dehumanization that follows a life in the public eye. The beginning of an exciting fiction career, An Absolutely Remarkable Thing is a bold and insightful novel of now.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781524743451'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1524743453'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",352.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.6.6.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gA1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gA1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gA1IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:AN+ABSOLUTELY+REMARKABLE+THING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gA1IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gA1IDwAAQBAJ,5.0,1.0,A Novel,,

A Spark of Light,['Jodi Picoult'],Ballantine Books,2018-10-02,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The author of Small Great Things returns with a powerful and provocative new novel about ordinary lives that intersect during a heart-stopping crisis. “Picoult at her fearless best . . . Timely, balanced and certain to inspire debate.”—The Washington Post The warm fall day starts like any other at the Center—a women’s reproductive health services clinic—its staff offering care to anyone who passes through its doors. Then, in late morning, a desperate and distraught gunman bursts in and opens fire, taking all inside hostage. After rushing to the scene, Hugh McElroy, a police hostage negotiator, sets up a perimeter and begins making a plan to communicate with the gunman. As his phone vibrates with incoming text messages he glances at it and, to his horror, finds out that his fifteen-year-old daughter, Wren, is inside the clinic. But Wren is not alone. She will share the next and tensest few hours of her young life with a cast of unforgettable characters: A nurse who calms her own panic in order to save the life of a wounded woman. A doctor who does his work not in spite of his faith but because of it, and who will find that faith tested as never before. A pro-life protester, disguised as a patient, who now stands in the crosshairs of the same rage she herself has felt. A young woman who has come to terminate her pregnancy. And the disturbed individual himself, vowing to be heard. Told in a daring and enthralling narrative structure that counts backward through the hours of the standoff, this is a story that traces its way back to what brought each of these very different individuals to the same place on this fateful day. One of the most fearless writers of our time, Jodi Picoult tackles a complicated issue in this gripping and nuanced novel. How do we balance the rights of pregnant women with the rights of the unborn they carry? What does it mean to be a good parent? A Spark of Light will inspire debate, conversation . . . and, hopefully, understanding.

People see colours in their dreams, as God uses these to teach and give us messages, it therefore becomes necessary for us to know the meanings of these colors.God has always been interested in colours. In Exodus 28:1 -6, God told Moses to make holy garments for Aaron, the high priest, and He gave him specific instructions about the colours....and they shall make garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto Me in the priest's office... of blue, and of purple, of scarlet and fine line (Exodus 28:4-6)Today, God still speaks about colours, this time spiritual colours through, and so we have to know their meanings. Spiritual colours are the colours we see in our dreams. We are not talking about physical colours that we have in the wardrobes and elsewhere. There is nothing wrong with any physical colours, as far as we know. We are only talking about the spiritual significance of the colours that God brings to teach us in dreams and visions, in Holy Ghost School. We should not in any way try to apply these discussions to the physical colours of our dresses and other materials we have. That is not the purpose.About HOLY GHOST SCHOOLGod's End-time Programme for the Preparation and Perfection of the Bride of ChristThat He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy, and without blemish (Ephesians 5: 27).- LaFAMCALL (End-time) Ministries","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1718058608'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781718058606'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",29.0,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}",,en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KLlKvAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:HOLY+GHOST&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KLlKvAEACAAJ&dq=intitle:HOLY+GHOST&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/SPIRITUAL_COLOURS_and_Their_Meanings_in.html?hl=&id=KLlKvAEACAAJ,,,,,

Bede's The Reckoning of Time (De temporum ratione) was the first comprehensive treatise on this subject and the model and reference for all subsequent teaching discussion and criticism of the Christian calendar. It is a systematic exposition of the Julian solar calendar and the Paschal table of Dionysius Exiguus, with their related formulae for calculating dates. But it is more than a technical handbook. Bede sets calendar lore within a broad scientific framework and a coherent Christian concept of time, and incorporates themes as diverse as the theory of tides and the doctrine of the millennium.

Now Ballard joins forces with Bosch to find out what happened to Daisy, and to finally bring her killer to justice. Along the way, the two detectives forge a fragile trust, but this new partnership is put to the test when the case takes an unexpected and dangerous turn. Dark Sacred Night for the first time brings together these two powerhouse detectives in a riveting story that unfolds with furious momentum. And it shows once more why ""there's no doubt Connelly is a master of crime fiction"" (Associated Press).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780316486675'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0316486671'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",448.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.17.17.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hp9IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Hp9IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hp9IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:DARK+SACRED+NIGHT&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Hp9IDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:DARK+SACRED+NIGHT&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Dark_Sacred_Night.html?hl=&id=Hp9IDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Catch a tiger by its toe. It's seared into Atlee Pine's memory: the kidnapper's chilling rhyme as he chose between six-year-old Atlee and her twin sister, Mercy. Mercy was taken. Atlee was spared. She never saw Mercy again. Three decades after that terrifying night, Atlee Pine works for the FBI. She's the lone agent assigned to the Shattered Rock, Arizona resident agency, which is responsible for protecting the Grand Canyon. So when one of the Grand Canyon's mules is found stabbed to death at the bottom of the canyon-and its rider missing-Pine is called in to investigate. It soon seems clear the lost tourist had something more clandestine than sightseeing in mind. But just as Pine begins to put together clues pointing to a terrifying plot, she's abruptly called off the case. If she disobeys direct orders by continuing to search for the missing man, it will mean the end of her career. But unless Pine keeps working the case and discovers the truth, it could spell the very end of democracy in America as we know it...

Fire & Blood,['George R. R. Martin'],Bantam,2018-11-20,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The history of the Targaryens comes to life in this masterly work, the inspiration for HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon “The thrill of Fire & Blood is the thrill of all Martin’s fantasy work: familiar myths debunked, the whole trope table flipped.”—Entertainment Weekly Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire & Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror, creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat, all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart. What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why was it so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom? What were Maegor the Cruel’s worst crimes? What was it like in Westeros when dragons ruled the skies? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty black-and-white illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed. With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire & Blood is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always fascinating history of Westeros. Praise for Fire & Blood “A masterpiece of popular historical fiction.” —The Sunday Times “The saga is a rich and dark one, full of both the title’s promised elements. . . . It’s hard not to thrill to the descriptions of dragons engaging in airborne combat, or the dilemma of whether defeated rulers should ‘bend the knee,’ ‘take the black’ and join the Night’s Watch, or simply meet an inventive and horrible end.”—The Guardian","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781524796297'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1524796298'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",737.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.20.15.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mj5XDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mj5XDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=Mj5XDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:FIRE+AND+BLOOD&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mj5XDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mj5XDwAAQBAJ,2.5,2.0,300 Years Before A Game of Thrones,,

Where the Crawdads Sing,['Delia Owens'],Penguin,2018-08-14,"NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE—The #1 New York Times bestselling worldwide sensation with more than 18 million copies sold, hailed by The New York Times Book Review as “a painfully beautiful first novel that is at once a murder mystery, a coming-of-age narrative and a celebration of nature.” For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life—until the unthinkable happens. Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780735219113'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0735219117'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",386.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.12.10.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CGVDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CGVDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=CGVDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:WHERE+THE+CRAWDADS+SING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CGVDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CGVDDwAAQBAJ,3.5,9.0,,,

Liar Liar,['Antonio Diaz LLL'],,2020-04-04,"Fletcher Reede is a crooked lawyer and divorced father living in Los Angeles. He loves spending time with his young son Max; they often play a game where Fletcher makes his hand into ""the Claw"" and pretends to chase Max with it. Fletcher, though, has a habit of giving precedence to his career, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife Audrey, and then lying about the reasons. Fletcher's compulsive lying has also built him a reputation as a successful defense lawyer in California as he climbs the ranks in the firm he works for. Ultimately, Fletcher misses his son's birthday party because he has sex with his boss Miranda, in the hopes of making partner. Max makes a birthday wish that his father would be unable to tell a lie for an entire day � a wish that immediately becomes true. Fletcher soon discovers, through a series of embarrassing incidents � such as when he tells Miranda that he has ""had better"" sex than he just did with her � that he is unable to lie, mislead, or even withhold a true answer. These incidents are inconvenient, as he is fighting a divorce case in court which, should he win, could be a boost to his career. His client is Samantha Cole, a gold-digger. His main witness, Kenneth Falk, who Samantha has been cheating with, is eager to commit perjury to win, but Fletcher discovers that he cannot even ask a question if he knows the answer will be a lie; during the case he even objects to himself when he tries to lie to get the desired information. Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her new boyfriend Jerry, and decides that Max will go with them to protect him from the disappointment Fletcher causes him when he breaks his promises. Fletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up, but he cannot conceal that he is able to continue, so the judge insists that he does. Finally, when Fletcher is bound to lose the case, he discovers that Samantha had lied about her age and therefore had signed the prenuptial agreement as a minor, rendering the contract void. This entitles Samantha to 50% of her husband, Richard Cole's marital assets, equal to $11.395 million, allowing Fletcher to win the case truthfully. Samantha then insists on contesting custody of their children for an extra $10,000 in child support payments from Richard. A visibly disheartened Fletcher watches as Samantha literally pulls the crying children out of Richard's arms. Appalled by the decision, Fletcher desperately tries to convince the judge to overturn the ruling, but he insults the judge's methods and is arrested for contempt of court. Fletcher calls Audrey to pay his bail, but she informs him that their plane leaves for Boston that night; his bail is eventually paid by his secretary, Greta.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9798633913453'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",102.0,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gHWDzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gHWDzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gHWDzQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:LIAR+LIAR&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gHWDzQEACAAJ&dq=intitle:LIAR+LIAR&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Liar_Liar.html?hl=&id=gHWDzQEACAAJ,,,Movie Script,,

Tracker is known far and wide for his skills as a hunter: ""He has a nose,"" people say. Engaged to track down a mysterious boy who disappeared three years earlier, Tracker breaks his own rule of always working alone when he finds himself part of a group that comes together to search for the boy. The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard. As Tracker follows the boy's scent--from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers--he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying? Drawing from African history and mythology and his own rich imagination, Marlon James has written a novel unlike anything that's come before it: a saga of breathtaking adventure that's also an ambitious, involving read. Defying categorization and full of unforgettable characters, Black Leopard, Red Wolf is both surprising and profound as it explores the fundamentals of truth, the limits of power, and our need to understand them both.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780735220195'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0735220190'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",640.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.5.5.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WtJfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WtJfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WtJfDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:BLACK+LEOPARD,+RED+WOLF&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.nl/books?id=WtJfDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:BLACK+LEOPARD,+RED+WOLF&hl=&source=gbs_api",https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Leopard_Red_Wolf.html?hl=&id=WtJfDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

In the late 1930s, sixteen-year-old Billy Parham captures a she-wolf that has been marauding his family's ranch. But instead of killing it, he decides to take it back to the mountains of Mexico. With that crossing, he begins an arduous and often dreamlike journey into a country where men meet ghosts and violence strikes as suddenly as heat-lightning—a world where there is no order ""save that which death has put there.""

Lost Roses,['Martha Hall Kelly'],Ballantine Books,2019-04-09,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The million-copy bestseller Lilac Girls introduced the real-life heroine Caroline Ferriday. Now Lost Roses, set a generation earlier and also inspired by true events, features Caroline’s mother, Eliza, and follows three equally indomitable women from St. Petersburg to Paris under the shadow of World War I. “Not only a brilliant historical tale, but a love song to all the ways our friendships carry us through the worst of times.”—Lisa Wingate, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Before We Were Yours It is 1914, and the world has been on the brink of war so often, many New Yorkers treat the subject with only passing interest. Eliza Ferriday is thrilled to be traveling to St. Petersburg with Sofya Streshnayva, a cousin of the Romanovs. The two met years ago one summer in Paris and became close confidantes. Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia: the church with the interior covered in jeweled mosaics, the Rembrandts at the tsar’s Winter Palace, the famous ballet. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia’s imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their country estate. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortune-teller’s daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their household. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya’s letters suddenly stop coming, she fears the worst for her best friend. From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg and aristocratic countryside estates to the avenues of Paris where a society of fallen Russian émigrés live to the mansions of Long Island, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways. In her newest powerful tale told through female-driven perspectives, Martha Hall Kelly celebrates the unbreakable bonds of women’s friendship, especially during the darkest days of history.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781524796389'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1524796387'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",466.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.7.7.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA107&dq=intitle:LOST+ROSES&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=77NkDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

City of Girls,['Elizabeth Gilbert'],Penguin,2019-06-04,"AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! From the # 1 New York Times bestselling author of Eat Pray Love and The Signature of All Things, a delicious novel of glamour, sex, and adventure, about a young woman discovering that you don't have to be a good girl to be a good person. ""A spellbinding novel about love, freedom, and finding your own happiness."" - PopSugar ""Intimate and richly sensual, razzle-dazzle with a hint of danger."" -USA Today ""Pairs well with a cocktail...or two."" -TheSkimm ""Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are."" Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love. In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest. Now eighty-nine years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is."" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698408326'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698408322'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",480.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CITY+OF+GIRLS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Mrs. Everything,['Jennifer Weiner'],Washington Square Press,2020-04-07,"In this instant New York Times bestseller and “multigenerational narrative that’s nothing short of brilliant” (People), two sisters’ lives from the 1950s to the present are explored as they struggle to find their places—and be true to themselves—in a rapidly evolving world from #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Weiner. Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise. Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life. But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after? In “her most sprawling and intensely personal novel to date” (Entertainment Weekly), Jennifer Weiner tells a “simply unputdownable” (Good Housekeeping) story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501133497'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501133497'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",496.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q9DVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=q9DVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=q9DVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MRS.+EVERYTHING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=q9DVDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:MRS.+EVERYTHING&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/Mrs_Everything.html?hl=&id=q9DVDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

Evvie Drake Starts Over,['Linda Holmes'],Ballantine Books,2019-06-25,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Read with Jenna Book Club Pick as Featured on Today • “Everything a romantic comedy should be: witty, relatable, and a little complicated.”—People A heartfelt debut about the unlikely relationship between a young woman who’s lost her husband and a major league pitcher who’s lost his game. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR In a sleepy seaside town in Maine, recently widowed Eveleth “Evvie” Drake rarely leaves her large, painfully empty house nearly a year after her husband’s death in a car crash. Everyone in town, even her best friend, Andy, thinks grief keeps her locked inside, and Evvie doesn’t correct them. Meanwhile, in New York City, Dean Tenney, former Major League pitcher and Andy’s childhood best friend, is wrestling with what miserable athletes living out their worst nightmares call the “yips”: he can’t throw straight anymore, and, even worse, he can’t figure out why. As the media storm heats up, an invitation from Andy to stay in Maine seems like the perfect chance to hit the reset button on Dean’s future. When he moves into an apartment at the back of Evvie’s house, the two make a deal: Dean won’t ask about Evvie’s late husband, and Evvie won’t ask about Dean’s baseball career. Rules, though, have a funny way of being broken—and what starts as an unexpected friendship soon turns into something more. To move forward, Evvie and Dean will have to reckon with their pasts—the friendships they’ve damaged, the secrets they’ve kept—but in life, as in baseball, there’s always a chance—up until the last out. A joyful, hilarious, and hope-filled debut, Evvie Drake Starts Over will have you cheering for the two most unlikely comebacks of the year—and will leave you wanting more from Linda Holmes.

The Nickel Boys,['Colson Whitehead'],Hachette UK,2019-07-16,"WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR FICTION 2020 WINNER OF THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL FICTION 2020 Winner of the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction 2020 Time #1 Novel of the Year 2019 ________________________________________________________________________ Author of The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys sentenced to a hellish reform school in 1960s Florida. Elwood Curtis has taken the words of Dr Martin Luther King to heart: he is as good as anyone. Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clear-sighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But given the time and the place, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy his future, and so Elwood arrives at The Nickel Academy, which claims to provide 'physical, intellectual and moral training' which will equip its inmates to become 'honorable and honest men'. In reality, the Nickel Academy is a chamber of horrors, where physical, emotional and sexual abuse is rife, where corrupt officials and tradesmen do a brisk trade in supplies intended for the school, and where any boy who resists is likely to disappear 'out back'. Stunned to find himself in this vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr King's ringing assertion, 'Throw us in jail, and we will still love you.' But Elwood's fellow inmate and new friend Turner thinks Elwood is naive and worse; the world is crooked, and the only way to survive is to emulate the cruelty and cynicism of their oppressors. The tension between Elwood's idealism and Turner's skepticism leads to a decision which will have decades-long repercussions. Based on the history of a real reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped and destroyed the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative by a great American novelist whose work is essential to understanding the current reality of the United States. 'If greatness is excellence sustained over time, then without question, Whitehead is one of the greatest of his generation.

One Good Deed,['David Baldacci'],An Archer Novel,2020-08-25,"In this fast-paced historical thriller, the #1 New York Times bestselling author introduces Archer, a WWII veteran forced to investigate a small-town murder -- or risk returning to prison. It's 1949. When war veteran Aloysius Archer is released from Carderock Prison, he is sent to Poca City on parole with a short list of do's and a much longer list of don'ts: do report regularly to his parole officer, don't go to bars, certainly don't drink alcohol, do get a job -- and don't ever associate with loose women. The small town quickly proves more complicated and dangerous than Archer's years serving in the war or his time in jail. Within a single night, his search for gainful employment -- and a stiff drink -- leads him to a local bar, where he is hired for what seems like a simple job: to collect a debt owed to a powerful local businessman, Hank Pittleman. Soon Archer discovers that recovering the debt won't be so easy.

The Turn of the Key,['Ruth Ware'],Simon & Schuster,2020-08-11,"The #1 instant bestseller from the Agatha Christie of our times. When Rowan stumbles across an ad for a live-in nanny, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—with a staggeringly generous salary. And when she arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” house fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture perfect family. What Rowan doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and Rowan in prison awaiting trial for murder. Writing to her lawyer from prison, Rowan struggles to explain the unravelling events that have led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the children, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant. It was everything. Rowan knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is. Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, this is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982157524'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982157526'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",384.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.0.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0fDwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0fDwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0fDwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA153&dq=intitle:THE+TURN+OF+THE+KEY&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0fDwDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+TURN+OF+THE+KEY&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Turn_of_the_Key.html?hl=&id=0fDwDwAAQBAJ,,,,,
The Bitterroots,['C.J. Box'],Minotaur Books,2019-08-13,"A riveting new novel from New York Times bestselling and Edgar Award-winning author C. J. Box. The ties that bind can burn you. Former sheriff’s investigator Cassie Dewell is trying to start her life over as in private practice. She’s her own boss and answers to no one, and that’s just the way she likes it after the past few tumultuous years. All that certainty changes when an old friend calls in a favor: she wants Cassie to help exonerate a man accused of assaulting a young woman from an influential family. Against her own better judgment, Cassie agrees. But out by the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, twisted family loyalty runs as deep as the ties to the land, and there's always something more to the story. The Kleinsassers have ruled this part of Montana for decades, and the Iron Cross Ranch is their stronghold. They want to see Blake Kleinsasser, the black sheep of the family, put away forever for the assault. As Cassie attempts to uncover the truth, she must fight against a family whose roots are tangled and deadly—as well as the ghosts of her own past that threaten to bring her down.

Old Bones,['Ron Chudley'],TouchWood Editions,2011-02-01,"Resting on what was left of the bench was something else, lighter in shade than the background, round, about the size of a cabbage. There were two large holes close together, a smaller pair below, then two rows of wedge-shaped objects. The pattern suddenly coalesced: in atavistic and chilling familiarity . . . In a remote British Columbia lake, an ancient auto wreck is discovered. Inside are the half-century-old remains of a traveler long lost and long forgotten. While there are few clues to the identity of the corpse, the discovery sets in motion a singular chain of events that dramatically affects a small and disparate group of people, each unknown to the other, but connected by history to the dead driver. Old agonies, unresolved quarrels, and desperate, dangerous secrets come to light, leading to a strange and surprising conclusion. Old Bones is the story of how a single circumstance can bring about huge changes in the lives of many people. “If we could only know,” observes one of the characters, “just how many lost souls are stashed beneath the earth, some likely as near as our neighbour’s yard, we would never sleep at night.

The Institute,['Stephen King'],Simon and Schuster,2019-09-10,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King whose “storytelling transcends genre” (Newsday) comes “another winner: creepy and touching and horrifyingly believable” (The Boston Globe) about a group of kids confronting evil. In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis’s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there’s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents—telekinesis and telepathy—who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, “like the roach motel,” Kalisha says. “You check in, but you don’t check out.” In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don’t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim disappears to Back Half, Luke becomes more and more desperate to get out and get help. But no one has ever escaped from the Institute. As psychically terrifying as Firestarter, and with the spectacular kid power of It, The Institute is “first-rate entertainment that has something important to say. We all need to listen” (The Washington Post).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982110598'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982110597'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",672.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.24.18.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iSKGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iSKGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iSKGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+INSTITUTE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iSKGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iSKGDwAAQBAJ,1.0,1.0,A Novel,,

When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known. So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the Deep South to dangerously idealistic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures. This is the dramatic story of an atrocity inflicted on generations of women, men, and children—the violent and capricious separation of families—and the war they waged to simply make lives with the people they loved. Written by one of today’s most exciting thinkers and writers, The Water Dancer is a propulsive, transcendent work that restores the humanity of those from whom everything was stolen. Praise for The Water Dancer “Ta-Nehisi Coates is the most important essayist in a generation and a writer who changed the national political conversation about race with his 2015 memoir, Between the World and Me. So naturally his debut novel comes with slightly unrealistic expectations—and then proceeds to exceed them. The Water Dancer . . . is a work of both staggering imagination and rich historical significance. . . . What’s most powerful is the way Coates enlists his notions of the fantastic, as well as his fluid prose, to probe a wound that never seems to heal. . . .

The Guardian of Lore,"['Vanessa Balleza', 'Navdeep Singh', 'Daniel Errico']",,2020-12-26,"While drawing in class to avoid listening to a story from his painfully boring teacher at Stagwood School, 12-year old Cal sees a frog staring at him through the window. Odder than that is the fact that this frog happens to be wearing glasses.Cal and his best friend, the tactless but loyal Soy, learn that the frog (who prefers the name Deli) has sought them out for a reason. When a school administrator named Ream reveals himself to be a dragon, the boys discover that fairytales are real, and that there is magic afoot in Stagwood. With Ream on their tail, the trio must unearth a powerful tool protected by riddles and rile (the magic that fuels nightmares) to save the fate of all fairytales past. Their only means on conveyance, Cal's now-flying bed, takes them on a journey beyond the home of the fairies (a cloud floating somewhere over Iceland) to set things right. But, before Cal can defeat Ream and his kidnapped army of fairies, he has to deal with Soy's knack for arguing with magical creatures, discover the truth about Deli's identity, and earn his place as the hero of the story.The Guardians of Lore is a middle grade novel that centers around two life-long friends, infusing humor and fantasy-based riddles into a modern fairytale. This is an exceptionally written intriguing piece of work that enthuses and imbues curiosity in young readers to discover the unknown with a spirit of adventure. Ideally, this is a book for children who enjoy folklore, mythical creatures and fairy tales.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9798586999160'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",94.0,BOOK,,NOT_MATURE,False,preview-1.0.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=usckzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=usckzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=usckzgEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+GUARDIANS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=usckzgEACAAJ&dq=intitle:THE+GUARDIANS&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Guardian_of_Lore.html?hl=&id=usckzgEACAAJ,5.0,1.0,,,

The Starless Sea,['Erin Morgenstern'],Anchor,2019-11-05,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • From the bestselling author of The Night Circus, a timeless love story set in a secret underground world—a place of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a mysterious book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues—a bee, a key, and a sword—that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780385541220'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0385541228'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",526.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.14.12.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+STARLESS+SEA&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:THE+STARLESS+SEA&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Starless_Sea.html?hl=&id=uYKDDwAAQBAJ,4.0,3.0,A Novel,,

Alix Chamberlain is a woman who gets what she wants and has made a living, with her confidence-driven brand, showing other women how to do the same. So she is shocked when her babysitter, Emira Tucker, is confronted while watching the Chamberlains' toddler one night, walking the aisles of their local high-end supermarket. The store's security guard, seeing a young black woman out late with a white child, accuses Emira of kidnapping two-year-old Briar. A small crowd gathers, a bystander films everything, and Emira is furious and humiliated. Alix resolves to make things right. But Emira herself is aimless, broke, and wary of Alix's desire to help. At twenty-five, she is about to lose her health insurance and has no idea what to do with her life. When the video of Emira unearths someone from Alix's past, both women find themselves on a crash course that will upend everything they think they know about themselves, and each other. With empathy and piercing social commentary, Such a Fun Age explores the stickiness of transactional relationships, what it means to make someone ""family,"" and the complicated reality of being a grown up.

The Quest for a Moral Compass,['Kenan Malik'],Atlantic Books Ltd,2014-05-01,"In this remarkable and groundbreaking book, Kenan Malik explores the history of moral thought as it has developed over three millennia, from Homer's Greece to Mao's China, from ancient India to modern America. It tells the stories of the great philosophers, and breathes life into their ideas, while also challenging many of our most cherished moral beliefs. Engaging and provocative, The Quest for a Moral Compass confronts some of humanity's deepest questions. Where do values come from? Is God necessary for moral guidance? Are there absolute moral truths? It also brings morality down to earth, showing how, throughout history, social needs and political desires have shaped moral thinking. It is a history of the world told through the history of moral thought, and a history of moral thought that casts new light on global history. At a time of great social turbulence and moral uncertainty, there will be few histories more important than this.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781782390305'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1782390308'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",339.0,BOOK,['History'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.11.11.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xxLUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xxLUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xxLUAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:MORAL+COMPASS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xxLUAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xxLUAgAAQBAJ,,,A Global History of Ethics,,

Golden in Death,['J. D. Robb'],St. Martin's Press,2020-02-04,"In the latest thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling series, homicide detective Eve Dallas investigates a murder with a mysterious motive—and a terrifying weapon. Pediatrician Kent Abner received the package on a beautiful April morning. Inside was a cheap trinket, a golden egg that could be opened into two halves. When he pried it apart, highly toxic airborne fumes entered his body—and killed him. After Eve Dallas calls the hazmat team—and undergoes testing to reassure both her and her husband that she hasn’t been exposed—it’s time to look into Dr. Abner’s past and relationships. Not every victim Eve encounters is an angel, but it seems that Abner came pretty close—though he did ruffle some feathers over the years by taking stands for the weak and defenseless. While the lab tries to identify the deadly toxin, Eve hunts for the sender. But when someone else dies in the same grisly manner, it becomes clear that she’s dealing with either a madman—or someone who has a hidden and elusive connection to both victims.

Crooked River Burning,['Mark Winegardner'],HarperCollins,2021-11-23,"In 1948 Cleveland was America's sixth largest city; by 1969 it was the twelfth. For Easterners, Cleveland is where the Midwest begins; for Westerners, it is where the East begins. In the summer of 1948, fourteen-year-old David Zielinsky can look forward to a job at the docks. Anne O'Connor, at twelve, is the apple of her political boss father's eye. David and Anne will meet-and fall in love-four years later, and for the next twenty years this pair will be reluctant star-crossed lovers in a troubled and turbulent country. A natural-born storyteller, Mark Winegardner spins an epic tale of those twenty years, artfully weaving such real-life Clevelanders as Eliot Ness, Alan Freed, and Carl Stokes into the tapestry. His narrative gifts may bring the fiction of E. L. Doctorow to some readers' minds, but Winegardner is very much his own man, and his observations of Cleveland are laced with a loving skepticism. His masterful saga of this conflicted city is a novel that speaks a memorable truth.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780358541325'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0358541328'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",591.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.3.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cSZMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cSZMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cSZMEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:CROOKED+RIVER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cSZMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cSZMEAAAQBAJ,,,,,

Camino Winds,['John Grisham'],Anchor,2020-04-28,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES AND USA TODAY BESTSELLER • “The perfect crime scene ... in the type of wild but smart caper that Grisham’s readers love.”—Delia Owens, author of Where the Crawdads Sing The master of the legal thriller sweeps you away to paradise for a little sun, sand, mystery, and mayhem. With Camino Winds, America’s favorite storyteller offers the perfect escape. Welcome back to Camino Island, where anything can happen—even a murder in the midst of a hurricane, which might prove to be the perfect crime... Just as Bruce Cable’s Bay Books is preparing for the return of bestselling author Mercer Mann, Hurricane Leo veers from its predicted course and heads straight for the island. Florida’s governor orders a mandatory evacuation, and most residents board up their houses and flee to the mainland, but Bruce decides to stay and ride out the storm. The hurricane is devastating: homes and condos are leveled, hotels and storefronts ruined, streets flooded, and a dozen people lose their lives. One of the apparent victims is Nelson Kerr, a friend of Bruce’s and an author of thrillers. But the nature of Nelson’s injuries suggests that the storm wasn’t the cause of his death: He has suffered several suspicious blows to the head. Who would want Nelson dead? The local police are overwhelmed in the aftermath of the storm and ill equipped to handle the case. Bruce begins to wonder if the shady characters in Nelson’s novels might be more real than fictional. And somewhere on Nelson’s computer is the manuscript of his new novel. Could the key to the case be right there—in black and white? As Bruce starts to investigate, what he discovers between the lines is more shocking than any of Nelson’s plot twists—and far more dangerous. Camino Winds is an irresistible romp and a perfectly thrilling beach read—# 1 bestselling author John Grisham at his beguiling best.

The Vanishing Half,['Brit Bennett'],Penguin,2020-06-02,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ONE OF BARACK OBAMA'S FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR NAMED A BEST BOOK OF 2020 BY THE NEW YORK TIMES * THE WASHINGTON POST * NPR * PEOPLE * TIME MAGAZINE* VANITY FAIR * GLAMOUR 2021 WOMEN'S PRIZE FINALIST “Bennett’s tone and style recalls James Baldwin and Jacqueline Woodson, but it’s especially reminiscent of Toni Morrison’s 1970 debut novel, The Bluest Eye.” —Kiley Reid, Wall Street Journal “A story of absolute, universal timelessness …For any era, it's an accomplished, affecting novel. For this moment, it's piercing, subtly wending its way toward questions about who we are and who we want to be….” – Entertainment Weekly From The New York Times-bestselling author of The Mothers, a stunning new novel about twin sisters, inseparable as children, who ultimately choose to live in two very different worlds, one black and one white. The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins. As with her New York Times-bestselling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing page-turner about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate and wise.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525536970'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525536973'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",354.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,3.11.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gxGuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gxGuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gxGuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+VANISHING+HALF&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gxGuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gxGuDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

SAMENVATTING - The Order Of Time / De Orde van de Tijd door Carlo Rovelli,['Shortcut Edition'],Shortcut Edition,,"Als je deze samenvatting leest, zul je leren dat tijd niet uniform is en dat veel van de mysteries eromheen zijn ontrafeld. Je zult ook leren : dat tijd niet op dezelfde manier stroomt op verschillende plaatsen en met verschillende snelheden; dat in de fundamentele fysica de barrière tussen verleden, heden en toekomst niet bestaat; dat vanuit microscopisch oogpunt de tijd niet stroomt; dat tijd elastisch is en dat het heden niet bestaat; dat de kwantumfysica kan verklaren waarom er sporen zijn van het verleden en niet van de toekomst. Mensen zijn wezens van de tijd. Ze hebben echter weinig begrip van de diepe aard van tijd. In dit boek geeft Carlo Rovelli, natuurkundige en grote naamgever van de looped kwantumzwaartekrachttheorie, een overzicht van de stand van de wetenschappelijke kennis over dit onderwerp. Het is voor hem ook een gelegenheid om meer filosofisch na te denken over onze relatie tot tijd.

Near Dark,['Stacey Abbott'],Bloomsbury Publishing,2020-10-29,"First released in 1987, Near Dark is a vampire film set in the contemporary American Midwest that tells the story of Caleb, a half-vampire trying to decide whether to embrace his vampire nature or return to his human family. The film, an early work of the now-established director Kathryn Bigelow, skilfully mixes genre conventions, combining gothic tropes with those of the Western, road movie and film noir, while also introducing elements of the outlaw romance genre. Stacey Abbott's study of the film addresses it as a genre hybrid that also challenges conventions of the vampire film. The vampires are morally ambiguous and undermine the class structures that have historically defined stories of the undead. These are not aristocrats but instead they capture the allure and horror of the disenfranchised and the underclass. As Abbott describes, Near Dark was crucial in consolidating Bigelow's standing as a director of significance at an early point in her career, not simply because of her visual art background, but because of the way in which she would from Near Dark onward re-envision other traditionally mainstream genres of filmmaking.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781911239284'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1911239287'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",113.0,BOOK,['Performing Arts'],NOT_MATURE,False,2.5.4.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nCjuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nCjuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nCjuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:NEAR+DARK&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nCjuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nCjuDwAAQBAJ,,,,,

A Private Cathedral,['James Lee Burke'],Simon and Schuster,2021-06-22,"""On his way to visit an inmate at a Texas prison who has promised him information, Detective Dave Robicheaux stops off at an amusement park to watch a teenaged Elvis-like rock-and-roller from his hometown of New Iberia named Johnny Shondell playing to a crowd of swooming young girls. One of them is another New Iberia teenager named Isolde Balangie. The Shondell and Balangie families are longtime rivals in the New Iberia criminal underworld. Yet Johnny and Isolde are in love. And like Romeo and Juliet, Johnny and Isolde are being kept apart by their families. In fact, Isolde tells Robicheaux, her parents have given her to the Shondell patriarch to be used as a sex slave. Seeking to uncover why, Robicheaux gets too close to both Isolde's mother and her father's mistress. As retribution, the elder Balangie orders a mysterious assassin to go after Robicheaux and his longtime partner, Clete Purcell. Yet this is unlike any hitman Robicheaux has ever faced: he has the ability induce hallucinations and might be a time-traveling reptilian. A Private Cathedral is both vintage James Lee Burke and one of his most inventive works to date--mixing romance, violence, mythology and science-fiction to produce a thrilling story about the all-consuming, all-conquering power of love.""--","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982151690'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982151692'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",384.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.2.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gAAwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gAAwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gAAwEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=intitle:A+PRIVATE+CATHEDRAL&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gAAwEAAAQBAJ&dq=intitle:A+PRIVATE+CATHEDRAL&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Private_Cathedral.html?hl=&id=gAAwEAAAQBAJ,,,A Dave Robicheaux Novel,,

A most welcome addition to the Kingsbridge series."" --The Washington Post It is 997 CE, the end of the Dark Ages. England is facing attacks from the Welsh in the west and the Vikings in the east.

A monk dreams of transforming his humble abbey into a center of learning that will be admired throughout Europe. And each in turn comes into dangerous conflict with a clever and ruthless bishop who will do anything to increase his wealth and power. Thirty years ago, Ken Follett published his most popular novel, The Pillars of the Earth.

Total Power,"['Vince Flynn', 'Kyle Mills']",Simon and Schuster,2020-09-15,"“One of the best thriller writers on the planet.” —The Real Book Spy In the next thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling Mitch Rapp series, it’s a race against the clock when ISIS takes out the entire US power grid and throws the country into chaos. When Mitch Rapp captures ISIS’s top technology expert, he reveals that he was on his way to meet a man who claims to have the ability to bring down America’s power grid. Rapp is determined to eliminate this shadowy figure, but the CIA’s trap fails. The Agency is still trying to determine what went wrong when ISIS operatives help this cyber terrorist do what he said he could—plunge the country into darkness. With no concept of how this unprecedented act was accomplished, the task of getting the power back on could take months. Perhaps even years. Rapp and his team embark on a desperate search for the only people who know how to repair the damage—the ones responsible. But his operating environment is like nothing he’s experienced before. Computers and communication networks are down, fuel can no longer be pumped from gas stations, water and sanitation systems are on the brink of collapse, and the supply of food is running out. Can Rapp get the lights back on before America descends irretrievably into chaos? This compulsive thriller proves once again that the Mitch Rapp series is “the best of the best when it comes to the world of special ops” (Booklist, starred review).","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501190674'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501190679'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",400.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,2.15.13.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IFXGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IFXGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IFXGDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:VINCE+FLYNN:+TOTAL+POWER&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IFXGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IFXGDwAAQBAJ,,,,,
The Book of Two Ways,['Jodi Picoult'],Ballantine Books,2020-09-22,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of Small Great Things and A Spark of Light comes a “powerful” (The Washington Post) novel about the choices that alter the course of our lives. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY MARIE CLAIRE Everything changes in a single moment for Dawn Edelstein. She’s on a plane when the flight attendant makes an announcement: Prepare for a crash landing. She braces herself as thoughts flash through her mind. The shocking thing is, the thoughts are not of her husband but of a man she last saw fifteen years ago: Wyatt Armstrong. Dawn, miraculously, survives the crash, but so do all the doubts that have suddenly been raised. She has led a good life. Back in Boston, there is her husband, Brian, their beloved daughter, and her work as a death doula, in which she helps ease the transition between life and death for her clients. But somewhere in Egypt is Wyatt Armstrong, who works as an archaeologist unearthing ancient burial sites, a career Dawn once studied for but was forced to abandon when life suddenly intervened. And now, when it seems that fate is offering her second chances, she is not as sure of the choice she once made. After the crash landing, the airline ensures that the survivors are seen by a doctor, then offers transportation to wherever they want to go. The obvious destination is to fly home, but she could take another path: return to the archaeological site she left years before, reconnect with Wyatt and their unresolved history, and maybe even complete her research on The Book of Two Ways—the first known map of the afterlife. As the story unfolds, Dawn’s two possible futures unspool side by side, as do the secrets and doubts long buried with them. Dawn must confront the questions she’s never truly asked: What does a life well lived look like? When we leave this earth, what do we leave behind? Do we make choices . . . or do our choices make us? And who would you be if you hadn’t turned out to be the person you are right now?","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781984818362'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1984818368'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",468.0,BOOK,['Fiction'],NOT_MATURE,True,1.7.8.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yQzLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yQzLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.nl/books?id=yQzLDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:THE+BOOK+OF+TWO+WAYS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yQzLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yQzLDwAAQBAJ,,,A Novel,,

The hero of A Time to Kill, one of the most popular novels of our time, returns in a courtroom drama that The New York Times says is ""riveting"" and ""suspenseful."" Clanton, Mississippi. 1990. Jake Brigance finds himself embroiled in a deeply divisive trial when the court appoints him attorney for Drew Gamble, a timid sixteen-year-old boy accused of murdering a local deputy. Many in Clanton want a swift trial and the death penalty, but Brigance digs in and discovers that there is more to the story than meets the eye. Jake’s fierce commitment to saving Drew from the gas chamber puts his career, his financial security, and the safety of his family on the line. In what may be the most personal and accomplished legal thriller of John Grisham’s storied career, we deepen our acquaintance with the iconic Southern town of Clanton and the vivid cast of characters that so many readers know and cherish. The result is a richly rewarding novel that is both timely and timeless, full of wit, drama, and—most of all—heart. Bursting with all the courthouse scheming, small-town intrigue, and stunning plot twists that have become the hallmarks of the master of the legal thriller, A Time for Mercy is John Grisham’s most powerful courtroom drama yet. There is a time to kill and a time for justice. Now comes A Time for Mercy.

I Would Leave Me If I Could.,['Halsey'],Simon & Schuster,2020-11-10,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Grammy Award–nominated, platinum-selling musician Halsey is heralded as one of the most compelling voices of her generation. In I Would Leave Me If I Could, she reveals never-before-seen poetry of longing, love, and the nuances of bipolar disorder. In this debut collection, Halsey bares her soul. Bringing the same artistry found in her lyrics, Halsey’s poems delve into the highs and lows of doomed relationships, family ties, sexuality, and mental illness. More hand grenades than confessions, these autobiographical poems explore and dismantle conventional notions of what it means to be a feminist in search of power.

The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson's #1 New York Times bestselling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game. After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar’s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move. Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin’s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength. At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure.
